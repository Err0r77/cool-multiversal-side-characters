The Soul Of Tolerance.
Role: Light Protector of Snowdin
STATS:
60 / 60 HP

25-130 ATK [The reason for maximum ATK being that high is due to its soul's capability. Usually at 25 otherwise though.]
20 DEF

SPD: UT Frisk's Speed, but can go at higher speed depending on the soul's condition.

WEAPON: White Energetic Sword [Formable, the reason for 25 ATK minimum and 130 ATK at maximum aswell.]
ARMOR: White Scarf [Undertale logic.]

LIKES:
Yet to be figured out, for now, those are the following:

Kindness, Econar likes coming across another person that doesn't seem to be like how most bad people are. This includes compliments and gifts too.

Peace, Econar usually likes peaceful areas, especially when snowdin town is not as popular.

Practicing with Uenceno, they're a really good friend to Econar and they seem to do the practice really well with it.

DISLIKES:
Yet to be figured out, for now, those are the following:

Being scared daily without a break, Econar is fine with one every week or a bit more, but not every day.

It doesn't appreciate being yelled at or such.

PERSONALITY:
Econar tends to be kind and possibly even polite, however young in how it behaves too, around 14-ish if to be age-wise.

They usually have trouble with saying words as quick as the average people do, usually ending up saying it a bit slower or more due to this.

Econar isn't immune to being scared, but becomes resistant when having the courage or just being brave in general.

It seems to be aware too of what goes on around it.

May have problems with fully expressing emotions, but that's probably due to not having experienced much of it, thus they may seem like they are strong on outside.

ACTIVITY'S WHEN NOTHING TO DO:
Econar sometimes leaves the RUINS to check on snowdin once in a while, remaining there till it's time for it to head back, usually helping people there and dealing with threats that aren't too hard to beat and leaving the dangerous or strong threats to a stronger protector, unless it has to deal with it on its own in time. [Zeroper for example.]

Econar also usually rests in RUINS too, often exploring too as their second choice to head to, but usually going back too when it thinks it should after a short while or so.

If Uenceno is present, Econar would usually go up to em and greet em, asking them about continuing the practice too, hence why Econar can do well at blocking or defending itself from attacks too.

MECHANICS:
Enduring Damage
Econar gains energy by taking damage, the energy gained being full damage amount while it can take negated damage, or rather calculated damage form of it. Having to rely on blocking than to dodge in order to survive.
This can also rival Determination significantly due to the soul's will to last the longest time possible.
The more energy Econar has, the more buffed its moves can become, even to the point where it can gain another phase, if it occurrs that it is the case, then upon losing all the HP, it regenerates itself back to full HP but suffers slightly shattered outline soul state, where it has lowered max HP till healed. [Soul damage type], but when active, the soul would be leaking white flames, though if that phase were to end due to out of energy, it would be in passed out state. Econar can regenerate HP fast or heal rapidly during that active phase however when it has not taken anymore damage for a bit after it did so.
Econar can also massively punish their foes for using a really powerful attack on it too with a move to deliver the damage back to them. Prime example being instant kill attacks here. Constantly using heavy attacks on it also leads to it gaining energy too.
The said active phase seems to be along the theme of 'Last as long as possible while keeping up the efficiency' aswell.
QUOTES:
" yeah, best for you to back off. "

" ow. "

COMBAT EFFECTIVENESS:
DIFFICULTY AGAINST IT: [Difficult] > [Unforgiving] - Econar while not a hard one to fight, can really fulfill their 'Light Protector' role really well with their simple but potentially deadly moveset. However it's only impossible to beat if the opponent tries to use instant kill move on it.

Econar will focus more on blocking than dodging, but doesn't mean they'll try and block a entire ult unless they can't escape it.

Econar is very well capable of piercing through target's DEF due to its moveset having a move meant for piercing defense, despite lacking in moves slightly for their moveset or abilities.

While it lacks in being able to respawn, it is made up with being able to last really long time, prepare for a long battle.

They can survive situations that would have killed too.



ABILITIES:
Econar is capable of strong attacks as long as they possess enough energy gained from taking damage to do so.
This 'Tolerance Soul' magic is to fear due to how it is here.
Tolerance Soul Magic
Shines in situations where the user of such soul has to endure, well capable of rivaling determination especially.

"Razor Energy" - Short bursts of energy that is explosive due to the energy usage. Up to three or so.

"Ranged Slash" - Fires one to three slashes, or 4 if it chooses to.
they do not have hard outer layer like determination has, meaning it weakens when over a medium distance while disappearing. Essentially less range but goes quicker in general.

"Concentrated Burst" - Energy blast in a ray line. DEF-Piercing type of attack? Most likely. Although unlike determination it doesn't deal as much damage. Good for tearing down low HP people who has too much DEF to take proper damage. Or to break a shield.

"Energy Unleashed" - Heavy-energy usage for a massive slash attack, meaning it's heavy and another heavy energy usage for such a powerful attack unleashed. If you think it'll dissolve over the distances, well, it's a literal dense slash what do you think that decay will do to it-
It's basically massive, dense slash attack. the size of it being heavy-energy usage, another for the density of it. so it can actually slice through someone without exploding if they're fragile enough, or any objects fragile enough in general.

"Damage Blitz" - Basically punisher to everybody who fails to control their damage, hits the sword on the ground via slam, then the ground glows white more and more, then the target within it radius explodes with the same damage it took that allowed it to use this attack. Single-target. The glow then fades after.
Minimal must be within instant-kill boundaries or just save up enough energy without dying somehow.
Impossible to avoid if you try to dodge the moment it explodes you.

ADVANTAGE:

This ability shines at most when people fails to control their damage, Allowing Econar to easily punish those kinds of people here.

Can be slightly versatile for a short moveset.

DISADVANTAGE:

Lacks in moves amount severely.

Being low on energy or magic would mean moves won't be boosted in strength or wouldn't appear stronger, conserving on that would be atleast recommended.

Basic moveset.

PROCESS:

None.
ETC:

None.



DESCRIPTION:
Econar, also known as the eighth soul, white child of endurance or tolerance.
They have large potential due to how their personality is, being aware of what goes on around them and such.
They tend to have practice fights or friendly spars with Uenceno, though ending up winning most of the time.

For a light protector of snowdin, Econar also happens to be able to do it alright too. A human they seem to know also seems to respect them and Aec aswell, this one being due to them having large potential for what they can be.

Although if it were to go on genocide, it is estimated that it'll have over 200 HP at max LV, which is terrifying and shouldn't be laughed at in general.

They reside in RUINS's house where they seem to consider it where they live in as a home aswell. But they don't seem to stay outside their home for too long either when going out, unless sometimes with looking over snowdin here.
