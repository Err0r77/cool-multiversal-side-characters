LIKES:

This frisk

Being pacifist

Helping out or repaying people for the help.

Learning and remembering about things. Especially being fond of some things, like water or fire! Since it doesn't know much about worlds yet. Not even planet earth.

Eating food or drinking drinks, while it doesn't need to eat or drink, being left 'hungry' or 'thirsty' will make it feel less well, so it's refreshing for em when they get to eat or drink something after a long time.

Being really nice friends with ST Frisk meant that it does care for them. Why is it on 'Likes' list? Because it likes to care about them and finds them a really nice friend too.

DISLIKES:
Absolutely doesn't like being left alone in that same black endless void for really long amount of time, especially when it has felt like years. Without anyone to help and being forgotten and being helpless too.

Brutal death scenes. Too much blood or gore especially those kinds of deaths can scare it. Or concern it at minimum of this on effect. Not having experienced fear much yet also makes it able to scared too.

Depending on how bad some people's cases can be or such. It can of course, feel bad for them. Keep this in mind.

PERSONALITY:
Very caring. Tends to tilt its head to the side a bit when confused. It also finds anyone interesting too.

It's also able to be described as kind.

A important part of its personality is that most of its sentences ends with double dots or atleast are spotted somewhere within it. Possibly demostrating its always-a-bit concerned behavior.

ACTIVITY'S WHEN NOTHING TO DO:
Not made yet. Although i'm pretty sure it wasn't going to be much anyways.
MECHANICS:
Soul condition
If anyone were to try and affect it soul, it would automatically fail due to the ability failing to find the soul. due to again, basically and literally already dying.
The gap in their code is also much worse than just large. It's basically like blank and barely any code found in there. basic read-only info only.
Their soul's more or less fragmented with each fragment being a really small gap for each. also glitching a lot too.
Alternatively in simplicity it codes are gone, but well, atleast not readable enough to be considered 'gone' anyways.
Side effects of complete paradox makes it hard for the frisk to forget memories by magic sources also.
Additional note: The frisk's current soul cannot be identified also due to the current condition of it.
Although it used to be determination so maybe it's staying the same way?
Additionally,
It gets constant pain from time to time. Which lasts for a short while or so and usually happens on random parts of it. Although this is mainly due to not being used to being in places outside endless black void.

Partial Fourth Wall Interference
It can 'read dialogues' or especially see ghosts or phantoms. Those 'meant-to-be-invisible' things.

Frozen Death State
Counted as dying, yet cannot be healed nor 'revived'.
If a heal attempt on it was to be made anyways, it would just throw a error or in another words, error from it the same way as how damage errored, but no jumpscare, anyways-
(effort to try and do anything with it dying state would fail due to how complete paradox is, too.)

Stability
Upon being hit, it will really hurt em but not damage em. with a loud save star loading sound being heard that keeps em in existence. [possibly LOAD attempts? either way, goodluck not being jumpscared by this-]
Whenever this happens, it takes stability damage instead of HP damage, and it can only be dealt up to 5% at maximum per damage.
Although the frisk can feel enough pain to be knocked out if that's too hard for you. Although to kill them would take a really long time of constant attacking till it finally gets a bit more corrupted and dies from it death process resuming.
Or in this case, getting self-deleted from corruption.
Usually it takes 0.1% or 0.5% from getting hit by normal attacks.
Self-regenerates if left unchanged for a while.
Example of this mechanic's function: Error 404's first god ray may freeze, but the next one won't kill it. Only deal 5% stability damage to it at maximum. It literally survived complete paradox once even if it can't do it again.
Its stability percent also cannot go over 200%, otherwise that resumes the death cycle and it'll immediately die.

Errored Stats
Its stats actually doesn't matter since despite it randomly changing. if it tries to smack someone, it will suddenly cause a jumpscare-like scale of glitch noises and the said blow having errored. It can only harm people if it's given a weapon.
DEF also errors, basically making any of it stats obsolete unless it gets something that can either take or tank blows and something that can deal damage through WEAPON ATK.

Hibernation Capability
It can enter hibernation state where it's just having a light sleep till someone makes a minor noise close to it or any minor interactions with it to wake it up. but can go on for even forever if it goes uninteracted that is. Hence it could set a certain time duration for it till the ability automatically wakes it up out of that state.

QUOTES:
Not added yet.
COMBAT EFFECTIVENESS:
DIFFICULTY AGAINST IT: [Peaceful] - This frisk barely dodges due to lack of fighting experience. Usually doing so once or twice before being hit. Its mechanic stunning it doesn't help either.

Doesn't do well with tolerating pain, so it can't really tolerate it well, if ever that is due to it not getting used to the constant pain and likely unable to anyways.

Note that it's extremely tanky as hell. So while beating it in overall is effortless.. Trying to kill it would be a difficulty tier 3 task.

Heavily lacks in attacking skills. Thus. It melees are only in very few numbers, usually being 1 or 2 strikes. Whether it be smacks, slams or slashes.

While not as good at hiding as EM Frisk, nor is it the best at surviving like EM Frisk is. It's good enough to atleast deter people that lacks common sense to check.



ABILITIES:
Paradox Frisk has minimal amount of abilities if not the least capable.
With that being said, do not expect to see much aside from its stranded magic side.
Unique Magic
This Paradox Frisk knows nothing about its abilities, nor would it happen to have any anyways.

"Nothing" - Does nothing.
ADVANTAGE:

Nothing.
DISADVANTAGE:

Nothing.
PROCESS:

Nothing.
Stranded Magic
The only magic its really equipped with. This is what gives Paradox Frisk a slightly better fighting chance.

"Soul Activation" - Auto-Added onto [ACT]. With enough progress, it turns from '???' to 'Soul Activation'. Usually occurs when under pressure for 5 turns or less. When ready. Its proper HP bar will flicker, showing [20/20]. With slight white glow from its soul.
Upon activation, it gains the said proper HP bar, however for each turn is 10% increase in stability. If its stability reaches 200%, it death cycle resumes and it immediately dies. However this increase is stopped when its proper HP bar hits 0, which then it stops.
ADVANTAGE:

If it achieves soul activation and its stability is at around 10%, paradox frisk will enjoy themselves with their stability rapidly recovering. Allowing them to survive near-death completely.

There may be more to it than just that for now.

DISADVANTAGE:

Course, with soul activation active it can also go over 100%, if it goes up to 200% or more, paradox frisk's death cycle will resume and it'll immediately die.
PROCESS:

Stay true to your trait.
ETC:

This is stranded magic, made by 'Friendly' here, so credits to em if anything.



DESCRIPTION:
The frisk that's most least willing to fight. Usually only tanking hits for people or being forced to fight a bit and usually fail at attacking.

It started out as when it got partially caught in complete paradox, which is now proven survivable, but that's in extremely rare odds. Due to this, it had lost its memory and now has to deal with being left alone in this, endless black void of space.

Eventually Cosmos Frisk came to visit and felt bad for it, leaving a rift open there that lets anyone come through it and rescue this frisk, even take it into their world to take care of them. [H!HM ended up doing so.]

Now, thanks to kind people, it has learnt more and more about things and can even get interest in other creatures and especially more info about Humans too. It wants nothing more than peace and tends to be seemingly-worried though.

When it comes to tanking, it's a force to be reckoned with because you literally can't one-shot it by almost all ways possible. The only way being to destroy it with complete paradox. Which the chances of that is extremely rare.

It does not want to get involved in conflicts but is alright with having people as a friend, leaning more on helping side of things too.

Overall, it's a frisk of which attacking it would basically be like commiting the biggest warcrime in history.
