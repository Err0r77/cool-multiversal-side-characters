The Carrier of Magic Constructs.
Role: 8th fallen. The carrier of phantoms, ghosts and spirits.
STATS:
500 / 500 HP
1000 / 1000 Shield HP [High resistance to elements that can easily beat it basically.]

50 ATK [Has 30 Default ATK usually?] [+30 from Chainsaw. Limited to 50 due to hard limit.]
45 DEF [Has 30 Default DEF usually?] [+15 from Heart Locket. Hard limit of 100 DEF.]
LV 1?

SPD: Slow [25%-50%] to UT Frisk's speed. Usually goes to walk speed when sacrificing its speed to deploy its auto spirits there.
Its evasion is basically non-existent completely, meaning it can get hit by any attacks thrown at it with exception of blue attacks here. Or orange when it attacks.

WEAPON: A literal chainsaw!
ARMOR: Heart Locket

LIKES:
Luck being in its favor.

Being cheered on by its construct friends or such.

Does seem to care about its magic construct friends though.

DISLIKES:
Luck not in its favor.

Being constantly attacked.

Near death situations.

PERSONALITY:
Its personality ain't much, but still has some things to it.

It does deal with conversations that are usually towards phantoms, ghosts, spirits of it unless otherwise. [Such as if the said magic construct friend is going to show it who can talk to the person if anything-]

It also has usual frisk's personality parts, but while aware and tends to be smart due to being a carrier, it can be cheered on and such. And it'll appreciate it.

It doesn't like near-deaths for obvious reasons.

ACTIVITY'S WHEN NOTHING TO DO:
It does seem to go around and find a spot where it could make use of 'Magic Collection', but immobilizes it during the process however. Seems to have a goal to return everytime it thinks it has gotten enough possibly?

It also checks on its surroundings to know what to watch out for, too.

It does get occupied with damage repairs too on self when needed aswell.

MECHANICS:
Shield HP
It can easily resist deletion or erasure attempts, this one has 1000 Shield HP, meaning it's not supposed to be easily killed.
Taking its soul or affecting it will have to get through Shield HP aswell.

The 'Capital Ship'-like Person
Both HP's carries over to next RP session or such.
Has 2 heal limits, one for healing items besides 'Heal HP' items and the other for its magic constructs, both of which are at 100.
No I-Frames however, but rather registers damage as damage per hit instead.

Carrier Damageable Parts
[6% damage per 3 damage. heal does 6% per 3 heal. healing items are unable to fix it unless they contain 'Part Heal' value.]
'Magic Flow' - 100%, destruction of it leads to disabled spell usage. vital to maintain.
'AutoSpirit Flow' - 50%, destruction of it leads to no more auto spirit summons.
'Shielding Flow' - 100%, destruction of it leads to making shield HP take high damage instead of medium. if not double. [50 to 100.]
'Damage Reduction' - 200%, if it hits 0, carrier frisk's defense drops to 0. doesn't count as critical, but vital to maintain. if it drops to half, frisk's defense drops by half.
Unspecified damage will be mostly hitting this one.
Destruction damage has a cooldown, if it gets destroyed immediately after fix, it'll not deal damage. usually remains disabled till the part reaches full HP again.
'Damage Reduction' is excluded, since it's always active, however holds no destruction damage if it hits 0.
Critical components, forces retreat after combat if any of the two's were to be destroyed. cannot be normally fixed upon destruction.
'Magic Generation' - 200%, critical component, destruction of it deals up to HALF of the entire carrier's MAX HP. where the rest's destruction deals only 25 HP damage to it.
'Travel Flow' - 200%, critical component, destruction of it disables it movement, returning capability too and may lead to overload, if not handled in time, detonates magic generation, leading to that one's side effects. deals 100 damage.
If the frisk's HP is low enough, it may be wounded, leading to extended parts of damageable parts:
Pretty much obvious listing here. but except it's 30% damage per 5 damage.

Magic Constructs
The fun part. Carrier Frisk can make Magic Constructs such as 'Phantom', 'Ghost' or 'Spirit' by use of a spell.
There's no limit to how strong they can get, mainly because they have no death restriction.
So they can pretty much really easily die.
However, those cannot be completely gone.
Delete them? sure, erasing them? boom, gone, but then they'll go back to their frisk carrier and ask for revival / reconstruction.
In another words, no matter how many times you kill those things or what way people do it in.
They can't completely get rid of it unless they kill the frisk carrier first.
The dead ones can then noclip through walls to go back to Carrier Frisk to ask for reconstruction. Yes, Magic Constructs cannot noclip unless they're dead.
If the construct frisk carrier made, manages to survive long enough after getting slight stats improvement, they'll become 'Ace Ghost' / 'Ace Phantom', where their stats are increased along with them gaining their unique ability too.
However, only one ace can exist at a time.
They also possess magic move to be able to pick up objects by surrounding it with aura. Although cannot grab foes with it. Or heavy objects.
Or they can shoot their aura at the target as a projectile to deal damage. Shooting it at the carrier leads to the carrier healing from it. Especially when it comes to patching it wounds up. If ghost shot at phantom, phantom heals.
While phantom cannot heal people, ghost can.
However, shooting the aura can also mean better throwing potential. [Magic Phantom's knife go YEET-]
Magic Ghosts cannot self-heal, so it's up to other magic ghosts to do it for them or Carrier Frisk can help them with that.
Those two classes can also hold onto frisk carrier and it'll carry em if anything. their HP is then protected since all damage towards them is redirected to frisk instead.
Think of that as basically hangar bay option. although fun to see a frisk with ghost's and phantom's just sleeping on it as it moves along.
Although that option's main purpose is since ghost's are slow, frisk carrier has more speed than them [medium], so that's going to be a fleet problem.
Unless that is introduced, so basically it can just carry the ghost's it made and have phantom's go along.
If the aura of magic constructs has already picked up a object, they cannot use their aura attack except for throwing the said item then.
Carrier Frisk also can only focus on reconstructing one magic construct at a time, too.
Aura Attack move of those magic constructs has unfortunately medium cooldown to begin with, so beware of that when doing your thing.
The summons also have to beware that focusing on attacking can lower evasion process aswell. They also cannot use aura attack move when being on carrier frisk aswell, so if they wish to use that, they'd have to deploy first before doing so.

POSSIBLE MAGIC CONSTRUCTS:
Magic Ghost
10 ATK 10 DEF 5 HP. [5 HP heal per aura attack used.]
Can go up to 20 ATK 20 DEF, 10 HP [10 HP heal per aura attack used.] if they survive a fight or last long enough.
Slow SPD however, slower than Carrier Frisk even unless the carrier has its auto spirits out.
Long I-Frames if it survives. [5 seconds I-Frames, basically.]
Multi-Purpose.
Can only get a sword at best with its aura magic. [Medium Objects.]
Ace:
40 ATK 20 DEF 20 HP and its speed now becomes normal. [20 HP heal per aura attack used.]
Magic Phantom
20 ATK 0 DEF 5 HP.
Can go up to 40 ATK 0 DEF, 10 HP if they survive a fight or last long enough.
Medium SPD.
Can only get a knife at best with its aura magic. [Light Objects.]
Magic Phantom can actually dodge attacks unlike the rest here.
Ace:
80 ATK 0 DEF 20 HP and its speed now becomes fast.

Magic Spirit
0 ATK 0 DEF NIL HP.
It can automatically become tier 2 over time instead. And can scout for others and inform them. Which has 100 ATK 0 DEF and 10 HP when in tier 2 aka stealth strikecraft set. [Basically can be one-shot'd.]
Don't use magic move if you're inside a object though when being as it, you'll blow yourself up. [unless you kamikaze.]
Medium SPD.
Has a upgrade tree towards escort if ace.
Ace Spirit automatically gets stunned for a minute straight the moment it becomes ace even, but gives them 50 HP and 50 DEF. If they don't die after the timer expires, Ace spirit turns into Escort kind here.

Auto Spirit
Deployable by Carrier Frisk but sacrifices Carrier Frisk's speed when done so till the auto spirits goes back into it.
Automatically on class of phantom's, meaning 5 ATK, 0 DEF, 1.25 HP. Half speed of phantom though.

Magic Escort
Can be Frisk or Chara, it doesn't matter.
100 HP, 50 DEF, 50 ATK. Keep in mind that it won't mean you can get another one, since there can only be one ace spirit or escort at a time.
Escorts have faster version of the magic move, usually able to have 4 of those aura's and shoot them. Also gaining 200 Shield HP too.

QUOTES:
There's none from it.
COMBAT EFFECTIVENESS:
DIFFICULTY AGAINST IT: [Difficult] > [Unforgiving] - It's hard to kill this one, but people should hope they don't end up fighting it when it has 5 phantom's around it.

Carrier Frisk's formidable due to the fact that as long as it has magic constructs around it, it cannot go down that easily then.

Despite its weaknesses, it doesn't mean it can be underestimated due to its attack potency aswell.

Carrier Frisk is also very well capable of tanking damage really well too, atleast until things starts to fall apart for it by then.

Due to its speed, Carrier Frisk can also move in, deploy the magic constructs there and then immediately go back to its place to leave those to do the objectives too.



ABILITIES:
Carrier Frisk on its own isn't really that troublesome due to being able to be picked off from a distance, but with its summons, may skies help you in that case.
Its spells are vital to know for especially when being a summon of it here, too. Keep this in mind for your survival.
Unique Magic
Carrier Frisk can perform certain spells that can hopefully help its summons along with itself and the place it comes from aswell.

"Form Restore" -
Carrier Frisk can cast 'Form Restore' where it'll turn towards a allied summon and heal them to full, killing all debuff status effects on it too and closing the wounds too if any.
Long cooldown however, so expect this to be done once in a medium battle case, or at best twice in a long battle case.
Can be treated as small repair bay for it.

"Magic Construct" -
Alternatively called 'Magic Reconstruct' when dealing with a dead magic construct.
Carrier Frisk casts a spell to make the magic construct here. However it can only focus on one at a time here, so it has to watch out for its losses aswell due to this.

"Magic Collection" -
Rolls a luck roll of 0 to 100 per minute when active, but immobilizes it while doing so.
Basically treated as 'Mining Beam' kinda thing, except instead of mining for items, it just attempts to collect any items it manages to find with the said ability.
If it hits 50, free healing item of 100 HP, if within 45 to 55, free healing item that has a random heal value of 20. If within 40 to 60. Healing item with heal value of 10. Otherwise, nothing gained in that case outside those ranges.

ADVANTAGE:

It can become extremely threatening quickly when it has its magic constructs with it, proving to be really troublesome for the foes.

Outrageous range aswell with its magic constructs, too.

It has a way of gaining healing items endlessly as long as the area isn't exhausted of the spots that it has gone to at the moment. [It has to switch to next spot after 5 minutes here, or basically 5 rolls in another words.]

Extremely capable of full heal and debuff killer in one move for its long cooldown.

It can constantly reconstruct dead magic constructs without concern for its magic capacity or how much magic it has left in that case, allowing for endless reconstruction of dead magic constructs and constant sending aswell. Assuming that the foe is being THAT troublesome to deal with, to begin with there.

DISADVANTAGE:

Cannot do damage repair on self, as such, it'll have to rely on Magic Ghosts for this or at the very least, make use of its healing items that it has, especially 'Heal HP' items here.

It's not that strong on its own, unfortunately. Even with its auto spirits active.

It can unfortunately get shredded badly if not careful.

ETC:

This unique magic cannot be learnt by others here, obviously.

This is basically aircraft carrier kind of character in the form of Frisk here, if no one reading this has realized yet, that is.


DESCRIPTION:
Carrier Frisk, one of characters made by NoobHero51Sword, is a rp character that makes use of co-op elements and shines a lot with it.

It's not really strong on its own and can be beaten without much trouble unless it has its auto spirits out. But if push comes to shove, it can quickly become threatening by deploying its magic constructs. Those are what makes up over 75% of the gosh darn overall combat capability from this character!
Even if one's dead, it'll be reconstructed once the dead one comes back to it for revival or such.

It's no laughing matter either, although while anyone can join Carrier Frisk by being magic phantom, magic ghost or magic spirit, it also has its own tools for support on its magic construct squadron aswell. Even if it isn't much here.

Overall a powerful character if not really powerful when it has good coordination here.
