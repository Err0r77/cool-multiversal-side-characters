The Sane Murderer who prepared.
Role: The Judge.
STATS:
85 / 85 HP
LV 17

43 ATK [33 + 10]
25 DEF [5 + 20]

SPD: Slightly higher than Normal Sans.

WEAPON: Burnt Pan [+10 ATK]
ARMOR: Temmie Armor [+20 DEF, although hidden under the jacket to make foes think that he isn't using any armor.]

LIKES:
Pacifist or kind humans. Having respect for those humans that never went down worse route there.

Phantom Papyrus. [despite him being a hallucination, hes basically papyrus but ghost.]

People in similar positions as him, basically like if he met another murder sans or such, those are the ones that he knows will understand him the most unless by rare cases that someone does. Infact, people getting the reason why he did this is what he likes the most than meeting those.

DISLIKES:
Humanity, although mainly focused on genocidal humans.

Interfering with other worlds, his problems is his and his only unless there's enough to say otherwise.

People still throwing themselves at it despite being warned multple times that they're fighting a battle that they're gonna die in.
Or them just refusing to listen to the sans and just fight just for sake of fighting or fame.

Himself, he knows that he doesn't deserve any better and hence he won't hesitate to let himself be called 'Murder Sans' or such. He basically hates himself for the path he took, but he knows that it had to be done if it meant to avoid going anymore insane than if he never took action.

Humans exploiting the partially-broken RESET, bugs or hacks even. Although this is only seen if the human does it in a bad / negative way.

Despises murder sans'es going down the path of dustdust.

This may be a fourth wall break, but he doesn't like overpowered characters, atleast the bad ones.

PERSONALITY:
This one does try and give advises to other murder sans'es if it ever comes that they may need some to get past their troubles of course.

He never interacts first unless interacted with or he finds a genocidal human that he can take on

He does try and make deaths quick in his world at the beginning of his plan, not long and painful

He will NOT agree to join nightmare no matter what, that'll just cause him to interfere with other worlds and besides, his world, his thing to take care of.

Insults won't work on it. As the quote goes: 'really? you think those would be reliable for you here? ...thats fun.'

It broke its first promise for a really good reason and it has its second promise that it'll keep so people won't swarm them next time they appear here. Protecting a very certain frisk that most may or may not know.

ACTIVITY'S WHEN NOTHING TO DO:
If outside his own world, he usually just waits and watches things, sometimes making a drawing on the snow there. Unless he finds a good way to get back to his own world, that is.

However when inside his own world, he has plenty of activity's such as training and such to pass the time to prevent himself from going insane there.

MECHANICS:
Counter-Attack Timer [Turn-based]
Throughout the fight, a timer may appear. Going from 10 to 0, at random number per cycle would be picked though and when it gets to it, the number would be highlighted as yellow, which means:
The attack has to be made immediately when the number turns yellow, otherwise sans WILL counter the attack.

Stranded Perseverance
Whether it be by struggling, having low HP or low on magic / stamina, as long as he keeps going without collapsing would mean his perseverance soul will start glowing. This also means he has another phase were he be struck down to critical HP. Where chaos can break loose from there.
Dusttale: FW Sans however has to be careful how much he'll be relying on this, because Perseverance is also similar to Determination, so unless he loses will but continues on to endure and survive, he WILL have high chance of melting before this is even seen in action aside from the bone's massive explosion move.

Magic Mastery
Dusttale: FW Sans figured out that he could extend his hand by use of his own magic to do so. Whether it be impaling someone suddenly or not.

AutoAttack Rampage
Starts with bone platforms at 4/10 turn, then becoming a blaster buildup autoattack at 6/10 turns, getting slightly faster as a warning sign at 9/10 turn, then rapid at 10/10.

Soul Jar
Depending on the target's HP, their screen borders may glow red if close to dangerous levels, if it goes within the dangerous levels, then it turns purple. In turn-based the target have only one chance to heal themselves before continuing when they get purple. If they don't, they have to prepare for their soul to be immediately thrown into a jar the moment he gets a chance to.

QUOTES:
" the good ol' trick of erupting blue attacks on people immediately... it ALWAYS works. "

" I hope you understand the consequences of your action. "

" oh c'mon, is me just standing there and watching really bothering you there? "

" what's that look for? it's not like i have anything else to do here anyways, besides, i've already done what i needed to do in my world. "

COMBAT EFFECTIVENESS:
DIFFICULTY AGAINST IT: [Hard] > [Unforgiving] - Goodluck to opponents fighting this sans. If the opponent's too predictable, they'll get finished off. If he figures out their weakness, they're also done. There's no telling what kind of attack patterns he'll pull.

Dusttale: FW Sans tends to catch rushers by either immediately countering them after analyzing their attacks or having blue glow on one of its hands and immediately countering them that way and delivering a powerful counter to them.

Confident Determination Users tends to lose their lives completely when fighting this, they're not safe either. If he notices that they're capable of respawning, he WILL find a way to counter it depending on how it is. For determination, he's going to lower their HP first before immediately throwing their soul into a jar.

The opponents also have to beware of what way this fight goes down in, it IS possible to one-shot the sans and avoid phase 2, but if on their first hit at vulnerable state [10/10 turns] it doesn't, prepare for hell of a attack turn.

If hes at LV 19 or 20, he'll gain spike in power, despite having to fend off the effects of LV to avoid going insane. This WILL make fighting the sans way harder than before since he can now tank hits.

Dusttale: FW Sans is aware of weapons use and such. Especially the armors use.



ABILITIES:
Dusttale: FW Sans is no laughing matter when it comes to attacks.
He knows that he can extend bone projectiles, break those in two manually and have sharp bones fire again but at different directions and him having the human soul magic now doesn't help opponents either.

His magic being way higher than UT Sans means that there's no potential chance of outlasting him aside from trying to outlast him by making him last too long enough for him to start melting a bit.

Unique Magic
Essentially sans's abilities. Seems way more powerful than usual, though.

"Expanded Bone Capability" - Summons a bone attack, be it bone jumps or bone barrage. Although this capability is extended, allowing him to extend bones or even cause deadlier patterns.

"Phantom Bones" - Hallucination bone attacks, those cannot harm the target but if sans ever sees them dodge a phantom bone attack in some patterns, he won't miss the chance to immediately punish them with a counter.

"Half Bones" - The selected bones snaps in half before then those 2 sharp bones are sent again towards another direction or at the opponent again. Can be used in a really creative way because of this capability.

"Blue Attack" - In addition to bone capability is that those attacks can be BLUE, making them harmless if the target stands still.

"Gaster Blaster" - Summons a blaster. It can fire or ram targets.

"Sturdy Blaster" - Large and slightly rusting but more durable kind of blasters that's powerful. The startup being that the ground rumbles for a bit, before those blasters erupts out of the ground. Their chargeup also includes the flicker in glow inside the blaster before blasting a powerful beam at its target.
Can hit hard if the opponent just stands still. Deadly, too.

"Expanded Blue Soul" - Applies a soul effect to the opponent. Being able to change force of the soul's gravity to any direction. Can be called 'Blue Magic'.
Dusttale: FW Sans however saw a large potential with this move and thus, turned it into a powerful attack.
Can also be used to freeze opponents.

"Blue Magic Slam" - Whether it is used for counter or not, what matters is that if the opponent is caught in it, sans will grab them before lifting them up into air along with himself slightly above the ground, before slamming them immediately into the ground. Causing a crater and deadly damage if successful.

"Battle Box Capability" - One of his attack patterns includes the battle box moving in a similar pattern to muffet's. And eventually when the battle box gets to left side again, the box's height reduces to soul's height and turns to the right, making it vertical. Then later on expanding out to more horizontal size while keeping vertical size the same.
Basically, goodluck with dodging attacks while that goes.

"Shortcut A" - Time and space capability leads to him being able to teleport with this method.

"Shortcut B" - Shortcuts time and space, in another words. Clink-clink. Allows it to prepare attacks during it and such, aswell.

"Healing Attacks" - Sans is capable of healing people with green healing version of bone attacks.

ADVANTAGE:

While he may lack in attack types here, he makes up for it by creative attack patterns,

His attacks are powerful and even able to deal large damage in quick succession if he happens to combo.

It IS compatible with stranded magic, making it even deadlier if sans ever manages to get to the point of using debuff and buff kinds of attacks.

KR isn't completely gone yet, since it still is inflicted on opponents that has high LV. Can really make enemies suffer because of this.

DISADVANTAGE:

Aside from its attack type being similar to what most sans'es have... However:

Using attack types that are often overused can lead to the opponent's dodging it more effective first try than if they had faced other characters.
Thus forcing the sans to adapt by using new attack patterns.

There's really nothing much else to say aside from that.

PROCESS:

There are no process for this.
ETC:

None.
Human Magic
Really few in moves for now, but still dangerous as hell with how it is.

"Explosive Bone" - Forming a bone with faint purple glow, tossing it over and exploding it can lead to a large to massive explosion with faint purple color to it. In another words: BOOM!
ADVANTAGE:

Powerful if used right, allows sans to have i-frames along with buttons and gaining LV.
DISADVANTAGE:

Try to not melt, i dare you.

Human souls persists before death. That includes this human soul.

Having high LV can take a toll on its sanity. Although could be negated by sans if he knows how to combat it.

PROCESS:

None for now.
ETC:

Not much to say here.
Stranded Magic
As if the opponent's life wasn't hellish enough, now there are attacks that can debuff or buff people! Even projectiles now that he had figured stuff out for.
Although the downside of this is that he has to be low in HP off at the start of the battle for it to even be at the point of making enemies life hell with this.

"Purple Attacks" - Purple attacks can now occur alongside blue and green ones, those can debuff or buff opponents that it hits, sometimes even used to buff its other attacks too!
Really deadly if used well. Especially if it's a purple blaster that debuffs, then there wouldn't be much use even if the opponent can overpower the sans, since its beam will be pushed back at first, then rapidly overpower the enemy's beam shortly after.
This meant in order to overpower this sans's attacks you're going to have to try WAY more than just that. due to the fact that when a stronger beam is shot at and this sans forms a blaster or two to combat it, the beam immediately slows down and then starts to get pushed back rapidly after that.
Perhaps one day we might even get to see him make a curved homing purple bone attack to precise strike people, too.

"Last Resort" - If everything else doesn't work for the sans, he'll resort to DEF-Debuffing purple blasters and blast the opponent constantly? The twist is that the opponent is CONSTANTLY frozen by blue magic and have to break out of it EACH time it happens or they are doomed to die to either blaster attacks or the last part's fatal damage.
Where the last part of this attack is him throwing ALL OF THE BLASTERS summoned in this attack at the target to deal terrific amounts of damage, either ensuring the kill or giving them the message that this would have ended them if it weren't for their defense.

ADVANTAGE:

If lucky, sans can get the chance to ultimately destroy their opponent.

Debuffs and buffs are what he was missing. And that's now filled in. Goodluck.

DISADVANTAGE:

Goodluck getting this to its full potential especially as a 'outsider' and without melting.
PROCESS:

Stay true to your trait.
ETC:

This is stranded perseverance class magic, made by 'Friendly' here, so credits to em if anything.



DESCRIPTION:
Also known as the sane murderer.
Thanks to this world's RESET button partially breaking that caused this sans to end up not forgetting after reset. Unfortunately, Dusttale Frisk took advantage of this. Thus. This sans resorted to a method to eliminate this problem and avoid going insane.

At first, preparing by getting the items and getting ready.

Then waited till another human fell, who had their soul taken by sans through way of weakening [by removing flowerbed so they get weakened enough for sans to deliver a finishing blow.]
and after that, went on a killing spree to eliminate the monsters that survived Dusttale Frisk's wrath.

Once they got to the maximum LV that he thinks that he can get, 14. He then confronts the human, either at last corridor or he goes out on a hunt for them.

He will then keep on trying new patterns, most with making them suffer in mind. First phase was up to 10 turns till he was vulnerable, but his second phase is relentless, being a survival phase. He would not stop till the enemy frisk's HP is low enough for their soul to be immediately taken.

If he were to be losing? Either by melting or getting too low in HP, he would simply flee from the fight and end up somewhere else, preparing again, before encountering the said frisk again.

Then repeating it that way till they run out of healing items, ending them this way via:

Capturing their soul in a pretty soul jar. After that. That was it. He then broke the barrier. Then fixed up the flowerbed. So anymore humans that fell down here would have their way back freely.

...While he is the only one in the underground, with his papyrus hallucination who still cares about him and still provides him ideas for drawings on the snow.

Dusttale: FW Sans is a force to be reckoned with.
