The Human-like Entity.
Role: [there's no au for it, but the character role of this was to make 2-players rps fun if anything-]
STATS:
20 / 20 HP [this does depend on its state though. this said HP also works different.]

80 ATK
20 DEF
LV 1

SPD: Depends, but can be fast and flexible.

WEAPON: Depends. Usually energetic chain weapon. Which has a handle at start with coursing magic or energy throughout the chains. Can inflict hitstun due to energetic flow of it. Otherwise it can use its Quiver and fire all of the energetic arrows at once, each one having small magic explosion on impact. Can be reloaded through forming more of them and reloading it.
ARMOR: None?

LIKES:
Depends, but main personality would appreciate it if the people meeting it knew that its states can randomly change and is out of its control there. Aside from that, it does like situations going uphill i guess.
DISLIKES:
Depends, but main personality is heavily against state mechanic, also doesn't like situations going downhill because of it either. Especially if it gets really bad to point of [CONTENT NOT SUITABLE DUE TO SAFETY.].

To add onto that, doesn't like how it has a time duration too and tries to keep its activity meter high aswell.

PERSONALITY:
Depends. But the people near it while it's not in main state can either feel friendliness from it or hostility, depending on Main State's friendship with them. This is also a part of omni-persona part too where Main State when not active has to watch itself do stuff. Beware.
ACTIVITY'S WHEN NOTHING TO DO:
Depends.

MECHANICS:
States
Basically thought of as multple personalities or such, it is random on what state it's usually is in. But can change due to HP being at 0, activity meter being too low or if one of two extreme conditions triggers. Or if its main state's time duration runs out.
The following states are the ones in existence as of now:
Kind: 20/20 HP, LV 1, basically friendly and really willing to help on sight. But its kindness can be exploited for betrayal and can't deal with many attacks well, or several fast ones even, which the said downfall about attacks applies to Chaotic State. Can form a barrier that's stationary, but upon the barrier being hit, it'll absorb the energy and heal aec. The barrier can be attached to end of its chain weapon too to be able to be slided around.
Chaotic: 56/56 HP, LV 10. Silent, less expressive than literally every other states, basically causes chaos at all costs and killing people when it has the chance to. Its focus however can be its downfall especially when at low HP. Additional ability, causes magic magnetic field around a object and throw them! Though has medium cooldown. And deals terrible damage if used on living beings. [0.1 Damage if used on beings.] However the further to end of its chain weapon, the brighter and deadlier the energy is, the most end of it being able to stick onto objects, which can make it explosive or rather, commit 'Debris Explosion' on impact.
Magic Magnetic Field tends to be activated and directed by hands. But also can be EX, which after its magic starts to spark up largely [that of which starts when down to 10 HP or under, EX can only be used once, long-cooldown.], makes it able to pick instead of one tree up, it can pick up five trees at maximum or one whole house.
Main: 20/20 HP, LV 1. Handle to chains to rod weaponry, rod part on most end of it being energetic. Basically heavily against its mechanics of states and actively tries to keep its activity meter high. Worried Thinker. But can really get encouraged to do a lot in fights and disregard the 'Worried' part if it manages to overcome it- However this does NOT expire by activity meter but by time duration, which can be extended by how many connected people is near it. Be it its enemies or its friends. Can teleport in a flash of light blue color, however has Conduct Stun where if it manages to land a melee hit, clash or block a melee twice, it'll cause conduct stun effect to the foe. Trying to also absorb conducting energy leads to stun. It can also leave behind a lasting field or energetic shockwave if it hits the metal ground hard enough too. Otherwise it would be a impact explosion. Capable of guardbreak due to energetic flow being able to break through after said impact through cracks and slicing right through. Energetic flow of its chain weapon is also intensive.
Emergency: 0/20 HP, LV ? [Starts at 1, usually.]. Automatically goes to this when its light blue pupil shatters from its HP reaching 0, its HP has to be above 10 or it'll fail in recovering from it, remain in it for too long and its soul will shatter. Does everything it can to ensure that it'll recover and repair its own HP, be it if it has to kill enemies in a brutal way or with cold methods, only talks when necessary.
Its unique ability in that state is likely increased strength, hell, it can even be called superstrength in that case.
Different HP Function [Delayed HP Damage Effect and Regeneration Effect]
It's HP works in a way of meaning two things but stops meaning much once it hits 0, the dying state.
If it takes body damage or any kind of damage, that damage later on would be regenerated in exchange for its HP lowering, basically delayed damage.
Upon its HP hitting 0, its light blue pupil will shatter and it'll be automatically switching into 'Emergency' State, where it'll do anything it can to repair its own HP, even if it means using cold methods of attacking its enemies.
Overkill damage beyond its HP are nullified by overkill regen effect aswell.
Meaning it's only AFTER 0 HP would overkill be able to kill.
Because then its regeneration type effect is just gone.
And regeneration actually has priority on fixing up damage, so there will still be slight injuries if it's anything like heavy wounds, focusing on closing up heavy wounds first before actually healing up later on when it gains the HP again.
So say Aec's body gets broken, it would regenerate, but end up in a heavily wounded state.
If the overkill regeneration effect is unable to stop the overkill damage from ending it however:
Then it resorts to protecting the soul and likely just throws it into 'Emergency' state again, as a result making only its soul the surviving one, or rather, being a 'loose soul'.
Except instead of 20 max HP, it's 120 max HP as so when it's above 100 HP, it could attempt to regenerate its own body.
Sicko Mode
122 HP, LV depends on its goal before sicko mode, 177 ATK, 144 DEF.
Activates if the state change happens too much or it gets given the 6 souls here. By then the only way to get it out is by having its activity meter drop too low or if its HP runs out. If it's like this due to too much mechanic change, then it'll resort to the activity that would be the highest, such as going from hero to villain instantly if there's no villain in the rp if anything.
QUOTES:
None for now.
COMBAT EFFECTIVENESS:
DIFFICULTY AGAINST IT: [Peaceful] > [Unforgiving] - Aec is a powerful if not formidable when in certain states, especially Main State, but if it goes 'Sicko Mode', the opponent should bare with the fact that they're going to get beaten up severely if not end up getting defeated fast.

There's no predicting its moves due to how many states and unique abilities it has here. The opponents that tries to rely on knowing all of its moves will have a hard time predicting them here.

Some state's weakness doesn't mean that if the opponent uses that against them it would always work.

Aec is a force to be reckoned with due to combo potential with its unique ability alongside its other mechanics.



ABILITIES:
It immediately becomes extremely formidable when it enters this state, making it much scarier to fight than each of its states alone.
There's no telling on how unpredictable it can quickly get here, especially with its abilities now able to scale up to the opponents if outmatched by such ways. The opponent is advised to not fight it solo due to how difficult the fight with such thing is!
Unique Magic
A completely off kind of capability that this entity possesses, yet again, there's no telling how unpredictable it can get. If scaled up, it would be able to perform multple abilities at same time in that case, or in another words, multple energetic chain weapons coming from it.

"Sicko Magic Magnetic Field" -
Empowered version of Magic Magnetic Field EX.
Nothing to laugh at here. It no longer requires hands controling it to be active, the only indicator of this ability activating is if objects are starting to be picked up. Can pick up 3 houses, more if scaled up.

"Sicko Barrier" -
Empowered version of Barrier EX.
Completely shields itself for a short while, but extended the more projectiles that hits it while still capable of healing itself by having it absorb energy from attacks that hits it. Could be either kinetic energy or not.

"Sicko Teleportation" -
Their light blue pupil will glow brightly as a indicator of this being activated, when active, it just outright allows it to teleport instantly in flash of light and have extreme speed boost for a short while applied to its attacks.
EX version of that move though would just be being able to do it multple times in a row but have long cooldown, but beware as this is one of moves where it can switch to that other variant instead.
May not be final in how this move is for now, so changes to it are to be expected.

"Sicko Conduct Stun" -
Any foes to not realize that trying to clash with its energetic chain weapon twice in a row will lead to way longer kind of conduct stun instead of the usual one, leading to massive punish.

"Wicked Deadly Energy Flow" -
Being hit by very far end of its energetic chain weapon leads to being sticked onto alongside being struck with deadlier damage.

"Sicko Strength" -
Beware of this one being upscaled!
Pretty much allows it to have strength like emergency state, but better.

"Quiver Unleashed" -
Inflicts crippled upon full hit now and apparently each arrow now actually causes a proper magic explosion.

"Absorption Annihilation" -
Sicko Mode's first unique ability that upgrades its existing case of 'what happens upon absorbing its energy':
Trying to absorb its energy leads to long conduct stun similar to what happens if the person tried to absorb its energy outside of sicko mode, however repeated attempts or continuing will lead to cruel fate of all vital parts of said character suddenly getting destroyed in the process or their absorption part suddenly suffering a near-instant rupture.

"Pinpoint Shatter" -
Sicko Mode's second unique ability, if its grey eye glows brightly, that's when its active. Makes its next move incapable of being deflected, let alone redirected or countered to be cancelled out.
If its grey pupil is shattered, the attempted effects will be reversed onto the attempting person instead. Debuffing them severely by 25% atleast.

ADVANTAGE:

Deadly as heck.

When upscaled, sicko mode is capable of using multple abilities at same time, allowing it to essentially destroy their opponents that tries to push through attacks completely or such.

Hard to cancel its abilities with this set aswell.

Maximum RP Activity!

DISADVANTAGE:

When not upscaled, it can only use one at a time and usually are telegraphed well or such.

Its upscale cannot go up to as much as 'Devoid Shadow' 's half of the power overall, still allowing them to defeat this one when needed.

Hard to activate at times.

Its deadliness could also spell its downfall depending on the opponent! [Most clear example being S-UM's or UM's.]

Using a ability cripples its evasion temporarily.

Does not have a phase 2 or any of that sort.

PROCESS:

N o n e !
ETC:

Possibly the most dangerous state out of the rest, highly advised for people to try and not end up activating this when handling Aec.



DESCRIPTION:
Aec, also known as Aceon aswell as their alternate name, is a human that can also be a entity aswell. Their HP along with their appearance can look off and their light blue eye along with their other eye being grey glows aswell. [Could be primarily grey glowing though.]

Their abilities are nothing to laugh at either, main state can launch their foes into air and slam them down, chaotic state can double trap and so on.

And them saving themselves during their emergency state that can hardly be stopped when at 0 HP can also be problematic for foes. (can even lead to death of the foe in first place if it is what it takes for it to survive!)

However they also try really hard to not cause troubles even if it's too late for them. Trying to cause more activity as much as they could that aren't troublesome to best of their abilities aswell. (Main State usually is aware of this and often the one doing it! The rest seems to barely remember what happened though during the other states.)

Although, given that one of the two extreme conditions occurrs, Aec or Aceon, can quickly go from being handled well to wiping the floor with everybody immediately.

Overall, can be really powerful, even formidable depending on circumstances, but often a unique character to come across. However is the hardest one to get along with people well, beware of that when having a character meet it.
