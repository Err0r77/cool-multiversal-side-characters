Seeker for Potential turned into Death Machine.
Role: 8th fallen.
STATS:
2000 / 2000 HP [1995 Magic HP, 5 Human HP.]

125 ATK [60 Magic ATK, 25 Physical ATK, 40 added magic ATK]
125 DEF [60 Magic DEF, 25 Physical DEF, 40 added magic DEF]

SPD: Normal

WEAPON: Worn Dagger [+15 ATK]
ARMOR: Heart Locket [+15 DEF]

LIKES:
Being helped out or comforted right.
May be possible to self-positivity by helping others, too. [this part isn't gonna age well though.]

This one's yet to be added.

Satisfaction from finding a way to fulfill a missing purpose by constructing a move for it after the struggle to do so.

Being in a peaceful, calm environment.

DISLIKES:
Yet to be added.
PERSONALITY:
This kind of variation is dead set on reaching towards the most potential it can get and would accept most things or so that it can get to achieve it. Unlike Magic Frisk who will NOT end up like how Hollow-Magic Frisk did.

Its personality seems to be more threatening

ACTIVITY'S WHEN NOTHING TO DO:
Hollow Magic Frisk is usually training alone.

It does interact with people a bit, but primarily watches when outside of that training.

MECHANICS:
Magic Exposure
If it's in a magic-radiated area, gets exposed to stranded magic and manages to survive it to learn it in the process or gets itself hit by a person's attack. [that person has to be around equal to this frisk or stronger than it.]
Then it will start taking in the magic to use them to improve itself and especially its own stats. [This will not heal it though.]
This is also due to its soul being mostly out of magic too.

Magic Maintenance
Due to how it form is made of magic, it magic should never, ever be too low.
If it happens that it does, it magical parts of it body will fade and disappear. And then the frisk will suffer a brutal death. Due to this, this frisk fears people abusing it weakness to their advantage, due to how life-threatening that weakness is to it.
It should also be mentioned that it should NEVER get too determined for too long or it'll melt. Unless it uses a way around it. Aside from that, all healing towards this frisk is multiplied by 10. [this means Pie can heal this frisk by 1000.]

Magic Mastery
Hollow Magic Frisk exceeds in its own magic's capability to construct a move from another one of its own move or through unique methods that makes a move work! However this is on deadly scale.

Magic Development
This frisk has multple stages of its magic development, starting from really weak to decent or even powerful.
[FORMING]
6 HP [1 Magic HP, 5 Human HP.]
1 Magic ATK, 1 Magic DEF.
The starting part of its magic, goes as far back as ruins section's starting place.
[BEGINNING]
20 HP [15 Magic HP, 5 Human HP.]
1 Magic ATK, 1 Magic DEF.
Close to snowdin, its Magic HP has increased but still not much use, yet.
[EARLY]
100 HP [95 Magic HP / Lifeforce, 5 Human HP.] (don't mind the sudden addition of 'Lifeforce' to the magic HP part, it's a alternative word to calling it if anything-)
5 Magic ATK, 5 Magic DEF.
Magic ability to use Magic HP as a way of defense to negate damage inbound towards Human HP is unlocked.
Snowdin, this frisk's Magic HP has built up high enough to now be some sort of use, but is still one-shotted by Real Knife unfortunately.
[MIDDLE]
1000 HP [995 Magic HP / Lifeforce, 5 Human HP.]
30 Magic ATK, 30 Magic DEF.
Magic abilities and spells are unlocked at this point on if anything.
Waterfall to hotland, at this point this magic frisk can survive 5 real knife hits and is strong enough to use more of its magic, too.
[LATE]
1500 HP [1495 Magic HP / Lifeforce, 5 Human HP.]
45 Magic ATK, 45 Magic DEF.
Nearing the maximum development before its magic exposure cannot be done anymore to improve its own stats. For that to be achieved would be to defeat ASGORE.
[COMPLETE]
2000 HP [1995 Magic HP / Lifeforce, 5 Human HP]
60 Magic ATK, 60 Magic DEF.
The maximum that its stats can get, from this point on it's at its strongest in magic stats aswell as the point where it has defeated ASGORE. Having achieved the ending that it wanted, which is pacifist. And now lives to help people onwards after it has accomplished one of things it wanted to do. Till now.

Equalized Tanker
Hollow Magic Frisk can choose whether to defend with Magic HP or to defend with Human HP. As up to this day, this frisk probably doesn't know how to dodge with Magic HP properly. It does know how to dodge with Human HP really well though.

QUOTES:
None yet.
COMBAT EFFECTIVENESS:
DIFFICULTY AGAINST IT: [Hard] > [Unforgiving] - For a variation, they're incredibly dangerous to come across, it can see weakness of people, counter blue magic and telekinesis with its aura magic to shield itself, from even mental effects. At worst it can see 5 seconds ahead of time! All the improvements made it much scarier than before.

Now with its improved flow of magic, along with stronger and improved kind of unique magic aswell, this meant it has way more moves potential than even original magic frisk itself.

Its future prediction within range of 5 seconds is also a massive problem, people have to actually catch it offguard in one way or another through countering reaction time methods.

Its attacks are lethal too, if not devastating. Getting hit by it in a combo is basically going to leave you heavily damaged if you don't have good stats to survive it.

Aura Magic is the most problematic as it ruins a LOT of guaranteed hits. It should not be tested.

Its undying-like state is also incredibly dangerous and often would mean everyone fighting against it would have a hard time trying to win against it.

Goodluck to anyone trying to do magic disruption against it if it manages to see into future 1 minute ahead. It would be a incredible feat if they manage it though.



ABILITIES:
Hollow-Magic Frisk, similar to Magic Frisk is also stacked, however has been improved HEAVILY on power and is more versatile than ever.
Their moveset are powerful aswell, if even enough to also match its killing machine title while doubling the problems with another magic that it has obtained now.
Unique Magic
Having been brought back like this by revival magic and its learning of its abilities, even having a human part, allowed it to develop it abilities extremely well.

"Grey Protection Spell" -
First magic ability obtained by Hollow-Magic Frisk here.
Can be applied to anyone that it targets, however there can only be one at a time. The target that it casts this upon will have their soul covered with grey coating.
If the said target takes damage, the spell will redirect most of the damage towards Hollow-Magic Frisk's Magic HP instead.
This can also help Hollow-Magic Frisk if it were to cast it upon itself, protecting it Human HP from too much damage.

"Shining Debuffer" -
Target type ability, no amount of speed will help you dodge this. Hold one of it hands out, then forming a shining light on it. When it fully disappears. Shockwave will blast [in another words, appear] at the target's position. Inflicting a debuff and a bit of damage to it.
(simplification of this ability: the only way one can avoid this is by interrupting it [by landing a hit] before the shining light fully disappears. which when it does, then it's basically too late and becomes unavoidable from that point on-)
(deals little damage, just smashes a debuff on the target.)
(significance of that debuff is high though in limits, that is if improved on enough.)
(so it can basically smash a debuff like 'Poison' or more.)
(More capable now due to Hollow-Magic Frisk's case, though.)

"Shining Buffer" -
Similar to Shining Debuffer, but the opposite of it effects, heals a bit and inflicts a status buff effect. Basically reverse process. Instead of shockwave happening from it, it's just shockwave going inward. This is also what marked the start of its healing magic.
(More capable now due to Hollow-Magic Frisk's case, though.)

"Shining Heal" -
Hollow-Magic Frisk holds one of it hands out as a green light appears on it. After 5 seconds of it being active, it'll then flash green for each second, healing the target of the move here. Can target any point of damage on the person to heal first so yes, it can target the biggest wound and start fixing that up first.
10 HP healed per second. [100 for Hollow-Magic Frisk if self-target.]

"Complete Heal Wave" -
Hollow-Magic Frisk holds out both of it hands, green light on both of it hands, then it puts the lights together and after it's active for 5 seconds, the light suddenly flashes and immediately is gone, causing the person it targeted with to be healed better than 'Shining Heal' via healing wave through em, however is more costly and has long cooldown unlike that move.

"Slicer Projectile" -
Upgrade from Heavy Magic Projectile, those have large slicing circle around the projectiles and still can explode.

"Magic Barrier" -
Hollow-Magic Frisk shields itself carefully and slowly with magic massively gathered around itself, cons of this, it has to stop moving completely.
pros of this, really strong defense. good against any attacks that DOESN'T pierce defense. Blue soul attempt on it is expected to automatically fail due to its immobilization.

"Energy Release" -
Obtained from having to learn Stranded Magic to save a friend, this is the move capable of turning into 'Heavy Outer Pulse' if Hollow-Magic Frisk is to release massive amounts of it or large even.
Although not as safe as 'Magic Vent', it does allow Hollow-Magic Frisk to release most if not all energy in span of a second to even instantly.
First way that it has when it comes to dealing with 'Magic Overload'.
'Energy Release' is basically quicker yet more destructive potential kind of letting magic out, like all at once or something like that.

"Magic Vent" -
Safer and even capable of passive effect, letting some magic out or even energy in a constant process, while it takes time, it's better than releasing all of it at once that can lead to explosion of its surroundings.
Second way that it has when it comes to dealing with 'Magic Overload'.
'Magic Vent' is a safer, more careful kind of letting magic out, but takes time to be fully complete on the purpose.

"Magic Reroute" -
Hollow-Magic Frisk dedicates more of it magic to holding itself together if needed. Although this raises the limit that it magic has to be above to not start dying that is, so beware of that.

"Magic Retrieval" -
2 Variants of this.
The first one makes use of vortex magic and 'Magic Vent', maximizing the Magic Vent and then using vortex magic to absorb a move's magic remains.
The second variant makes use of the newly made projectile design, 8 magic vent's on it and the projectile being mostly hollow, allowing for magic absorption which will make it bright again.
Those projectiles have slight automation to absorb Hollow-Magic Frisk's move remains that were used in combat. But once they're full or done with absorption, they then bring it back to Hollow-Magic Frisk inside and give em the said magic it was holding.
This allows Hollow-Magic Frisk to double-cast moves that are possible to easily absorb magic's remains of. [For example: Pulse, Magic Explosion and such.]
The second variant can be automatic or passive.

"Shining Strike" -
Hollow-Magic Frisk swings it hand to a direction, sending a short-burst of some sort of magic form, inspiration from reverse-vortex barrier design one. Can quickly get a hit in and start a combo too.

"Rapid Hit Magic Rotation" -
Activates 'Magic Vent' to maximum and then.. Unleash shining strike in all 4 directions, rotating and constantly performed! Allows for constant damage being dealt to opponents that are at close range. At a cost of constant magic cost AND being more vulnerable to taking damage.
Now 8.

"Dot Halo" -
Passive for it stick, combats any attempts of the foe trying to take it weapon, be it yanking the weapon back immediately with dot magic around it enough. Or to stun the opponent if it stranded magic fails to stun em.

"Magic Dash" -
Hollow-Magic Frisk makes use of recoil knockback to launch itself in a direction in order to dodge a attack. Be mindful of the amount of magic or energy remaining though. Using several in short amount of time is going to be too draining for it. Even then, only a few can be used per battle there. Make them count.

"Loaded Shot" -
Charges up and then saves the move for later, firing a sudden heavy magic projectile when time calls for it.

"Overcharged Beam [Miniature]" -
It starts off with a startup.. Then a sudden burst of light occurs, not as bright.. Then it then fires off a quick powerful beam.
A move turned into a weapon.

"Overcharged Beam" -
Hollow-Magic Frisk charges up through a startup charge, then soon after, a bright burst of light happens before it immediately fires off a large to massive, really powerful beam.
Getting hit directly by a non-miniature move usually leads to the target being crippled so in another words, dodging it is completely advised.
Might aswell watch out for potential effects that beam can inflict too.
Non-miniature one has high stranded magic cost if it is to make use of that, so it has to be determined enough if anything atleast, being a bit out of it safe limits is the miniature one, when it can do something like 'Energy Release' being turned into 'Heavy Outer Pulse' though, THEN it can do this.

SOUL MAGIC:
This category has not been learnt yet by this Hollow-Magic Frisk.

BEAM MAGIC:
Due to Hollow-Magic Frisk's benefits, they are now capable of beam attacks aswell.

"Basic Beam Attack" -
Fires a charged beam, sparkles appearing around its hand before firing it for a bit. Or it can happen at any parts of its magical body too.

WEAPON MAGIC:
Hollow-Magic Frisk's now more capable of manifesting weapons into existence and finds them reliable, thus allowing for extremely deadly potential from it.

"Weapon Manifest Combo 1" -
Form a energetic longsword, or scythe and spin slash, before immediately manifesting it into a hammer and slamming it on the ground with high force, causing a energetic shockwave.

"Weapon Manifest Combo 2" -
Form a energetic spear, slash whether it is to redirect a incoming melee attack or not, and then follow up with fast movement of few energetic sword slashes while moving forward fast and then form a second energetic spear, stab both into the target and pin em. Allowing for a long combo of magic attack here.

"Weapon Manifest Combo 3" -
Form a energetic axe, slash upward to send the opponent into air, then manifest the weapon into scythe and form another. Then slash both at the opponent to immediately grab them for a bit with the blades and eventually suddenly throw them down into ground.

"Weapon Manifest Counter 1" -
Prediction required, form a energetic scythe and immediately catch the incoming foe's melee attack, disarm them quickly and manifest the scythe into a greatsword to immediately slice em.

DOT MAGIC:
Those attacks are small, speedy and capable of curving. For a basic magic attack tool, those can destroy stamina quickly. Especially its first attack move.

"Dot Shotgun" -
Hollow-Magic Frisk summons several small magic projectile, that in the shape of a dot with a trail, that can fire all at once. Requires no hand movement. So don't even think making the frisk stuck there would stop it here. However has a short cooldown despite it being spammable to maintain efficient magic usage.

"Medium Gathering Strike" -
Hollow-Magic Frisk forms constant small magic projectiles and gathers them up to form a medium magic projectile, before then firing it. Can manually split off into small magic projectiles at any moment too.

"Large Gathering Strike" -
Same process as above, but large magic projectile.

"Dot Sphere" -
Special move if the process is to be kept going. Unleashes a dot sphere on the target, giving them a terrible time especially with stray dot projectile being sent everywhere. Hardly dodgeable.

VORTEX MAGIC:
This magic category's usually draining for Hollow-Magic Frisk here, hence it doesn't really use it often.. But if it has to, well, it will.

"Vortex Shot" -
Magic projectile with some sort of energetic short sawblade, however unleashing vortex particles around itself that can throw projectiles around. Especially causing dot magic projectiles to go in unpredictable directions. Can be thrown up to 2 of those in one attack or move, however maintaining the vortex effects will drain it magic constantly, so it's recommended to not have those out for too long.
Considered to be Hollow-Magic Frisk's heavy magic attack.

"Reverse-Vortex Barrier" -
Hollow-Magic Frisk gets ready.. Then after having it hands crossing each other, swing them outward to form a strangely-formed magic infront of itself that tends to repell incoming attacks away, including it own though. Drains magic constantly till the barrier disappears though. So use it wisely.

"Piercing Accelerator" -
Hollow-Magic Frisk makes use of vortex magic to accelerate it, and then immediately makes it disappear to launch the said projectile. With slight usage of vortex magic again to make sure it's correctly aimed too.
If boosted by stranded magic, completely pierces through block's or even instant killing shield's if anything that is.
It makes use of 2 vortex projectiles, one for orbit. the other for acceleration, the accelerator-role vortex projectile then moves around the orbit-role one, making sure it never goes offcourse till too much acceleration is applied to it.

"Magic Hurricane" -
Makes use of the vortex projectiles along with unleashing large amounts of small magic projectiles, maybe throw in a few heavy magic projectiles there as a bonus. Then takes all surrounding's attacks and brings them into the hurricane attack, strengthening it even further. Deals rapid damage and such due to this, devastating if used right.
Considered as a special attack.
This is also draining for the Hollow-Magic Frisk here too, especially more than usual the longer this goes on. Use with caution.

PULSE MAGIC:
This magic's useful for taking care of invading objects or even blasting your point-blank range foes to oblivion with this AoE move. Although had some risk at same time aswell.

"Magic Explosion" -
This move was learnt during the process of trying to learn Pulse Magic in 2 parts, due to this move being representation of the failed process. This usually happens if Hollow-Magic Frisk isn't careful with some types of pulses. Inflicts self-damage along with damaging surroundings aswell.
Reminder that Hollow-Magic Frisk CAN use this as a weapon and CAN use it to fully self-destruct itself to nuke its surroundings.

"Inner Pulse" -
Kinda self-explanatory, it grey parts flashes throughout its body like a sort of pulse, even going through human parts of it and not taking much damage from it. Either utilizing vortex magic partially for the process or other kinds of results used in this.
Anything from roots going inside, any planted invading device inside or even invasive magic can be pulse'd in effort to destroy the said invasive element.
There are pros and cons to this though, for one, never try to destroy stranded magic with stranded magic-boosted inner pulse since it's better off using something that doesn't have possibility in theory of accidently causing results worse if it did this.
Potential benefit though is that it might be able to turn this move into a way of destroying magic flow blockade, although that might have to be calculated about later.
You CAN potentially kill a creature that tries to burrow inside with this too.
And it can be combo'd with Magic Vent to further help with getting invasive elements out.

"Outer Pulse" -
Hoolow-Magic Frisk forms slight magic barrier around itself and then performing 'Magic Explosion', but more controlled outside itself.. Mostly as if magic barrier shot out the explosion while protecting itself from it.
The magic barrier part is to negate self-damage a lot, atleast enough to be insignificant.
However, it surroundings in turn gets blasted. Now imagine if you were hit by this at point-blank range, not only that but this move is efficient at this too.

"Charge Pulse" -
Similar to inner pulse, except the moment the pulse reached the edge or border of itself, the erupting pulse escaped outside thanks to 'Magic Vent' and few other supporting moves. No self-damage, but less damage than outer pulse. Basically 1-Burst Pulse.

"Burst Pulse" -
Similar to previous one.. But instead of grey parts flashing white as pulse spreaded throughout once, it was 5 times, gathering up at border or edge of itself [probably awarding it outline glow.], till then..
And then what do ya know, the Hollow-Magic Frisk's surroundings just suddenly exploded in energetic, magic explosion process. More of a pulse though, but now it really is powerful, stronger than the outer pulse variation.
Looks devastating too if anyone were to be caught being hit by it at point-blank.
Although the drawback of this move pretty much became clear quickly since it gets 'stunned', as in collapsed after draining itself slightly or more doing this move. Before getting back up atleast seconds later after doing this.

"Eruption Strike" -
Hollow-Magic Frisk casts eruptions from its hands, allowing for additional hits before the actual melee occurrence. In another words, bonus pre-hits before the actual melee.

CONTINUATION IN ABILITIES PART 2.



Continuation of this magic here. If it wasn't self-explanatory enough.

"Shining Burst" -
Despite its can-be-draining properties, it's a dangerous move to be hit by. Usually a automatic move, up to one at a time loaded to be quick-performed.
On cast, it's a target type ability, a immediate shockwave at target's positions, forming the small lights that flashes once, then already being invisible after the light flash and then blowing up.
However that is accompanied by a second shockwave, inward. Depending on variations, the invisible lights may or may not get drawn towards. If it gets drawn towards, it's going to be thrown into surrounding areas before exploding. If not, the usual.
There are 3 variations to this. First one is the one with light's flash being bright, meaning it's not as light as second variant, which means it'll explode target's position.
Second one is the light's flash being less brighter, or not that bright in this case. This means it'll explode target's surrounding areas.
Third one is a quick one, it's only one shockwave and the light's are bright, immediately blowing up quickly. The only difference between this and the other two's is that the light's fades quicker, so beware.

"Sparkling Shine" -
A move completely incapable of combat, but good for creating good scenery. Hollow-Magic Frisk holds out one of its hands, or even have a finger do it instead. When active, it'll emit sparkling particles. and the slight flame effect that decays quick aswell when using draw variation. Why flame effect? To make it look nicer atleast.
Really customizable though, particles can be made to last longer or fade in and out from time to time and such.
Can be turned into "Sparkling Draw', where the particles will last as long as possible and the slight flame-like particles makes its appearance in that variation.

"Bouncing Piercer" -
Introduces the 'Armed' property of the move where magic builds up on part of its body there, which is one of its hand in this case, basically aims a hand forward and if it's armed already, fire off a magic bouncing piercer! Projectile design of it being that it has slight magic barrier at the front that's held together by the magic structure part, while still exploding if it couldn't pierce through or can't bounce off of it!
Bounces if it fails to pierce and is angled enough to do it, otherwise explode!
It does look sharp though, like it's a short rod with sharp end.
The explosions those projectiles create are small due to being 'Bouncing' and 'Piercing' type together, unfortunately.
Medium Magic Cost though, so try to not use too many of those. At maximum of 5, although to be safe, only try atleast 1 or 2 of those projectiles to remain efficient.

"Fast Cannon Dance" -
Aim with a hand while building up charge in both hands, form a quick magic barrier and immediately release the charge through it, then outer pulse through that. Firing a quick variant of magic cannon with knockback that then causes it to step back, and aim with other one and so it repeats!
This move however has been made faster due to the events now.

"Magic Lockdown" -
Automatic passive ability, this usually mostly activates when Hollow-Magic Frisk loses a limb or magic leak occurs, where it will close off a magic flow or as the name suggests, 'Lockdown' a section to prevent it. Allowing for stable magic flow while fighting, even when heavily injured!

SOUL MAGIC [Page 2]:

DOT MAGIC [Page 2]:

"Homing Capability" - Useless for now or just not as efficient, Hollow-Magic Frisk forms some small magic projectiles that can curve inside its own projectiles that it's forming. The cons here however overwhelms the pros, unfortunately.

VORTEX MAGIC [Page 2]

PULSE MAGIC [Page 2]:

REVIVAL MAGIC:
Yes, i'm serious. Hollow-Magic Frisk is starting to be more capable of Revival Magic slowly over time. Although that can't go without consequences for the full revival magic usage here.

" Magic Patch " - Lost a limb? No problem, just grab it and fix it up before you drop dead aswell. By attaching it back on through magic vent method and reconstructing some parts of the targeted part, assuming that it isn't gone yet.

AURA MAGIC:
This one's COMPLETELY DIFFERENT from all other kinds of magics it has, thanks to it getting eye infused with magic, it has aura magic that it can use to shield itself from telekinesis-type moves along with mental influence.

"Third Eye/Sense" -
By far the most powerful capability it has, Just due to how broken this is, being:
Predict the future for 5 seconds. Maximum potential of 1 minute. Can see weaknesses of people aswell.

ADVANTAGE:

First of all, this magic's multipurpose as HECK.

Second of all, this magic can be efficient and can be enhanced with stranded magic as long as it works, as ALL HECK.

Third of all, this magic has massive advantage of moves construction.

Fourth of all, EVERY SINGLE MOVES FULFILLS THEIR PURPOSES TO ALL HELL!

FIFTH OF ALL, IT EXCEEDS IN- You get it basically. Hollow-Magic Frisk exceeds in magic. And it has over 30 moves in this.

OH AND SIXTH OF ALL, MOST IF NOT ALL ARE POWERFUL-

DISADVANTAGE:

Suffers a possible disadvantage if up against Hollow-Magic Frisk's weakness.

For what it makes up in massive multipurpose capability is that it tends to have trouble using those moves in other situations than they are meant for.

PROCESS:

This unique magic cannot be learnt by others.
Stranded Magic up next in Abilities Part 3.



Stranded Magic
Requires Hollow-Magic Frisk to be determined enough for proper use.

Obtained during it first time of stopping BW Chara's Overload due to being determined to save them, this magic is proven to be really useful to this frisk. Allowing it to pierce through defense and blow up a area.
If this frisk ever breaks mentally beyond repair, this frisk's stranded magic is going to be buffed.
This can literally be applied to any kinds of moves from Unique Magic, as long as Hollow-Magic Frisk finds a way to make it work that is. Beware of the results though.

FORMABLE MAGIC:
These moves are in there first priority if it can be formed without help of this frisk's magical stick.
"Resistance Shift" -
Gain increased resistance towards a energy type or such, if high enough in progression, it becomes choosing of either magic or physical.
Can increase it resistance against a status effect if it doesn't wish to increase it against magic or physical.
"Magic Flare" -
Can be done by the stick or by it hand, deploys a bright projectile that just floats and drifts away in a direction. But immediately explodes when a projectile gets near it, flinging it offcourse, can be done constantly for more of those things to protect itself completely from that direction.
"Magic Mine" -
Magic Flare's alternate variant, those actually have damaging detonations if anything.
"Magic AoE Mine" -
Magic Mine's one of variants, less damage but more AoE radius, good for catching dodging people.
"Cone Barrier" -
Required with magic flare to be fully effective, this cone barrier rapidly spins, changing it middle point and requiring a precise attack that would miss the frisk to be able to destroy it effectively. Having it open hand out forward deploys this.
"Upgraded Move" -
Makes use of stranded magic to enhance one of Magic Frisk's Magic Set. It cannot lead back to stranded magic itself though.
Has special interactions with some moves too.
"Magic Sense" -
Anti-Ambush tool, but can also be used like a radar to find where others are at.
"Magic Sonar Wave" -
'Whatever you detect, detects you aswell.' Makes use of Magic Sense partially and Unique Magic aswell to do this move.
2 Variations,
All-Around - Less range, but goes in all directions.
Directional - More range but less directions.
it sends out magic boosted by stranded magic as a wave, which reveals itself immediately, but does the same to whoever's caught by it too. Since it can be traced, but also traces whoever it gets to. Basically makes use of 'Magic Sense' and attempts to incorporate it into the magic sent out there, and returns the wave back after it gets something.
The magic sent out are also partially main magic to be able to come back to it user if anything-
It holds it hand out and have it open, then it performs the magic wave there, it can also hold it out forward and do the other variation instead, which is cone-direction instead of all-around.
Long to Very-Long Ranged Move for Detection.
"Lightful Shot" -
Light attack. Both ways, literal and in attack type term. It holds it hand out and unleashes a bright projectile that can do medium damage but goes in a straight line, can be constantly fired.
"Touch Denial" -
Can be passive or not. Makes use of stranded magic to have them be at the edge of itself, however 'Magic Vent' will be disabled if it does this, gains a outline in the process.
However allows for quick-performing 'Outer Pulse' kind of move, except it would be full of stranded magic damage if anything.
"Second Strike" -
Uses it free hand to swipe it while rapidly producing 'Lightful Shot' projectiles, which decays fast but can immediately explode if it hits the target.
"First Strike" -
Upgraded version of Second Strike, hold out one of its hands towards it opponent, then perform a large or massive version of 'Second Strike' as it swung it hand away and then right at em! Making it seem like a white energetic flamethrower at this point for its first attack entrance.
"Charged Weapon" -
Magic Frisk charges some stranded magic into the weapon.. Then it can be used at will! Making it do more damage while also causing AoE explosion aswell.
The red trail also going further out as a wave for it AoE.
"Flaring Minelayer" -
Gather up small magic projectiles and then store magic mines in it, then launch the magic projectile construct forward as it scatters magic mines as it travels!
"Burst Shot" -
Heavy Magic Projectiles, fired 3 times in a burst!
"Leaf Formation" -
Forms a leaf projectile without the requirement of the stick, however the stick being imbued in magic allows for enhanced properties, likely.
"Leaf Ground Control" -
Form leaves to fly around scattering stranded magic particles on the ground, purpose being to prevent ground-based attacks from succeeding or just damaging anyone underground.
"Overload Beam" -
Similar to overcharged beam, however this one primarily relies on stranded magic in case of situations where stranded magic is too much for the frisk. A massive burst of red light at first, before firing a devastating beam that can cripple almost anybody that it hits.
A special move to say the least.

STICK MAGIC:
These moves are in this category if they require magical stick to work effectively, either that or it cannot be simply formed without its stick's help.

"Leaf Wave" -
Waves the stick, unleashing leaf attacks this way.
"Stick Staff" -
Charged weapon's special interaction, forms lightful projectile on end of the stick and then makes it as if it made it stick melee-capable aswell!
"Orb Splash" -
It gets ready... Then slams the weapon on the ground, the projectile hitting first for it to suddenly scatter across the ground similar to liquid, but full of stranded magic!
"Stick-Assisted Accelerator" -
Vortex magic's smaller but makes use of the projectile, then makes it stronger with stranded magic, and then literally shoots it with stranded magic too, making for a powerful railgun-like move.
It points the weapon forward, then the charging process can begin.
Still makes use of 2 vortex projectiles but smaller, charged with stranded magic and disappears really fast upon forming to fire, since it'll be flicked to high vortex speed effect before immediately vanishing to fire the projectile. the stick assisting it with stranded magic to send it even faster.
Upon firing it, it gets knocked back, but the projectile's sent at extreme speeds, guaranteeing any block kills or even shield kills. or even piercing through it instantly!
Although the payload of this must be a small projectile or it won't be at extreme speeds.
Deals Pulse AoE damage to it surroundings after firing it, though.
More efficient than doing this completely with normal or unique magic though.
"Magic Cannon" -
Points it stick forward, rapid build up to the front of the stick, with magic barrier around it to form the barrel.. Close the entrance to it [but atleast leaving a small hole for the recoil reduction-] and then fire it!
It gets sent back slightly after firing it, but that projectile is powerful and can even explode in a large explosion or so if anything.
"Crossbow: Cluster" -
Load a leaf, making use of stranded magic to power the thing and all.. With main magic mixed in for the crossbow design.. Then it can now start loading stuff in after or it can fire if already loaded, with dot magic's small magic projectiles around the leaf to serve as additional payload! Triggering the payload manually doesn't disrupt the leaf projectile if anything.
"Crossbow: Heavy" - Load a leaf, then give it some lightful shot projectile with slight dot magic to hold it. Then shoot it and watch as getting a direct hit on enemies can lead to them getting heavy damage instead of medium.
"Crossbow: Advanced Guide" - Load a leaf, then give it couple of dot magic projectiles to make it better on being guided or homing if it was one. And if it wasn't, it just turns it into a guided projectile or homing.
"Stick-Assisted Forcefield' / 'Lightening Forcefield" -
Rain spreading particles from above! Point it stick up, and start forming a wide constant-regenerating forcefield that protects itself and any of it allies within it.
ADVANTAGE:

Really strong magic when staying to its trait, has multple soul stages and can even be powerful enough to wreck havoc.
Can be multipurpose by some slight form and can be mixed with its unique magic!
Exceeds in Guard-Breaking and AoE capabilities!
Capable of paralyzing the opponents if they attempt to interact with its soul by grabbing or such, even a lot to know about it!
DISADVANTAGE:

Hollow-Magic Frisk will melt if they stay too determined for too long, suffering loss in DEF first, then ATK and then SPD, before completely melting. They CAN become an amalgamate. Although it can be delayed by using stranded magic to maintain the magical parts, but melting on the inside CAN occur in that case instead.
Doesn't rely on reducing the opponent's options too much for what DT Class Stranded Magic can do.
Ultimately, its out of luck if it wants to use this off the bat. Its soul stages are mostly achieved through being in higher danger.
This magic has serious consequences. Multple to list here.
PROCESS:

Stay true to your trait.
ETC:

This is stranded magic, made by 'Friendly' here, so credits to em if anything.




DESCRIPTION:
A what-if case on if Magic Frisk were to search for ways to be at its maximum potential a bit if not way too much there. In another words, basically seeking to be at its maximum potential too much there, which is something Magic Frisk won't do there, since they look for ways for them to be at their maximum potential sure, but not THAT far.

Hollow-Magic Frisk is the scarier kind, not to mention their expanded capability allows them to handle stronger foes and gain the absolutely broken ability of all time: 'Third Eye / Sense', this allows it to find out weaknesses of their opponents somehow along with seeing into the future for 5 seconds at minimum, up to 1 minute at maximum of the potential.

The said broken ability being from the fact that this Frisk just got taken into a place, the person then gave them eye infused with magic. Which improved and strengthened their magic capability in overall with exception of one: Stranded Magic. This also includes better control of its flow of magic.
This said eye can be evolved with their own magic. But prefers to do it later. When that happens is unknown, though.

Beating this would be a impressive feat alone. Especially on how powerful it has gotten, there's no telling if it would be more aggressive or not. But one can only hope that it doesn't end up like that, anyways.
