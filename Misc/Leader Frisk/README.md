73 DEF
LV 16

SPD: UT Frisk's Speed.

LIKES:
Offering people tea.

Nice sight of the flowers.

Positive situations.

DISLIKES:
Being reminded of the past. [Though usually tries to handle it anyways.]

Having to fight a monster even if it didn't want to.

Having to fight a human, even if it doesn't like having to anyways.

PERSONALITY:
Leader Frisk doesn't seem to be as determined as the usual frisk's are, likely due to having regrets for their actions in the past but still tries to help monsterkind nevertheless.

It also holds back in fights too, usually not dodging attacks, even taking more damage and dealing less damage aswell.

Everytime it seems to meet a new human, there seems to be 1 in 4 chance that it'll offer them a encounter at the barrier, giving them a opportunity to not do it too if they don't wanna as of yet, too. Since it's unwilling for it to fight another pacifist human here, but it would have to.

It's also not willing much to try and fight a monster too.

Although outside the combat case, it does try and offer people around itself some tea, maybe asking them about how the sight of nice flowers here are for them too.

It does try to keep the fight fair or good, too.

If it's fighting a genocider, that said person should realize that this Frisk would be really willing to protect the monsterkind till death, then.

ACTIVITY'S WHEN NOTHING TO DO:
It usually takes a journey or travels throughout the underground from throne room to snowdin and so on.

It also tends to be at its place resting, watching over the flowers and enjoying the nice sight of it.

Likely also still tries making tea too.

MECHANICS:
Shining Soul
Leader Frisk can shine their soul on a attack to turn the said attack red, causing it to have higher attack power.

Unwillingness
If the person it's fighting against lasts long enough and has positive goals or basically pacifist in another words. Since it doesn't like to fight people that has good intentions.
Then it will be lessing willing, causing its DEF to drop slightly.

QUOTES:
None for now.
COMBAT EFFECTIVENESS:
DIFFICULTY AGAINST IT: [Difficult] > [Unforgiving] - It could have been way more dangerous if it became determined, but still strong on its own despite everything.


ABILITIES:
Leader Frisk isn't very well determined, due to this, they have a disadvantage but their stats and abilities tends to say otherwise.
When put into a strong use, those abilities can actually become a massive problem quick.
Unique Magic
This one has slight difference, leaning more towards Deltarune here for some nice references, but can be powerful if used right, anyways.

"Shining Soul" -
Leader Frisk shines their soul on a attack, turning the said attack red and causing it to have higher attack power too.
ADVANTAGE:

It does have large potential for what this could also be, even if it isn't much.

Essentially able to support others with use of increasing attack's power.

DISADVANTAGE:

Lacks heavily in moves, especially attacks.

Not much for a supposed support here.

ETC:

This moveset can't really be learnt by others here.
Asgore Magic
Not much to expect here.

"Fireball Capability" -
It can form a fireball, especially in forms of attacks like fireball circle and such.

"Colored Trident" -
Leader Frisk still knows how to do this attack, being able to do colored trident slash attack at will.

ADVANTAGE:

Asgore Magic. May or may not have a advantage depending on the person's experience with it.
DISADVANTAGE:

Asgore Magic. May or may not have a disadvantage depending on the person's experience with it.
ETC:

Leader Frisk tends to use their creativity or such to make strong attacks even with this few of a magic moves at its disposal here.


DESCRIPTION:
Leader Frisk is a Frisk based on a what-if where Frisk actually took Asgore's Soul after defeating them. [yes, the said person had this much EXP to begin with-]

Unfortunately, as much as Frisk wanted to leave though, it can't really leave the underground like this without someone to help lead it. Due to this, Frisk eventually regrets the said decision, but has to live with it since they thought it was the best that they can get to.

It's unaware that there is a way to do true pacifist with Asgore, unfortunately. And it has lost most of its will compared to its past self before the events, not being all that determined is also a disadvantage for it too due to this.

But after taking upon the role anyway by itself, it hoped that maybe it could handle the situations well and help the monsterkind. But of course, that'd only work better when it manages to deal with the initial effects first or rather responding to the reactions the monsterkind may have.

While its set is powerful if not extremely powerful surprisingly enough, most of the potential isn't really put into use due to how it is, but tries its best at things anyways.

...But this is going to be a tough time for them.
