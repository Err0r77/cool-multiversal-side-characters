##Determined, magical semi-human being.
##Role: 8th fallen.

###STATS:
2000 / 2000 HP [1995 Magic HP, 5 Human HP.]

85 ATK [60 Magic ATK, 25 Physical ATK]
85 DEF [60 Magic DEF, 25 Physical DEF]

SPD: Normal

WEAPON: Upgraded Dagger [+25 ATK, inflicts bleeding damage on hit.]
ARMOR: Upgraded Locket [+25 DEF, Human HP regeneration effect.]
###LIKES:
- Being helped out or comforted right.
May be possible to self-positivity by helping others, too.

- Being less lonely atleast. [Recent.]

- Satisfaction from finding a way to fulfill a missing purpose by constructing a move for it after the struggle to do so.

- Being in a peaceful, calm environment.

###DISLIKES:
- It really doesn't like causing accidents.
Mainly due to being affected mentally if they end up killing someone by accident, especially suddenly. And especially after witnessing its chara finish them off in order for the frisk to not gain any EXP in the process too.

- Its chara's potential action's are also what makes it concerned too, being unsure if it'll be able to handle all of that. Also due to the problem of having to try to not use [FIGHT] unless the opponent doesn't let it use [MERCY]. It's hard for it to survive like this in multiversal world's. **There is a way it can break mentally from this.**

- It also doesn't like interfering with other world's aswell. If it can't avoid it, then atleast not too much. [usually thanks to its chara here-]

- It already has burden of having lost a friend, especially when it could not return the favor to them for being a really good friend to them. Especially since they helped keep it less lonely. Even to the point of wanting to have taken it instead of them, despite them helping magic frisk avoid a attack's blow.
This means it can't really afford to lose another really good friend here.

###PERSONALITY:
- It seems to prioritize on developing it magic development stage to maximum first, before helping others. [Depending on if it's possible to go for it.]
Imagine you are friends with this frisk, and when it spots a attack that it can take and improve from magic exposure? It just suddenly dashes off to there.

- There isn't much positivity to how it interacts. Can be clear by how most of it interactions ends with a '.' than a - for it detail. [Recent.]

- It can be told on if it's feeling well by whether it says hello and waves or if it just waves.

- Unlike HM, EM and Outer: CD, this one actually doesn't do much comforting, but may specialize more through words to comfort people.

- Infact, it's different from these 3 frisk's due to preferring to talk as its greeting, saying hello. Can be considered possibly neutral / positive greeting.

- Due to having lost a really good friend and having to keep some promises, it can be protective of its friends. Although usually kept in check, but if it gets too dangerous, it will take action.

###ACTIVITY'S WHEN NOTHING TO DO:
- Magic Frisk often considers about training their magic and usually does so.

- Alternatively, it can be out to help friends that it knows, especially its chara that it hopes to help atleast some time.

- Or it can be usually out on watching, sometimes mentally helping a person or so. Unless it ends up becoming friends with them, then the above happens.

###MECHANICS:
- **Magic Exposure**
If it's in a magic-radiated area, gets exposed to stranded magic and manages to survive it to learn it in the process or gets itself hit by a person's attack. [that person has to be around equal to this frisk or stronger than it.]
Then it will start taking in the magic to use them to improve itself and especially its own stats. [This will not heal it though.]
This is also due to its soul being mostly out of magic too.

- **Magic Maintenance**
Due to how it form is made of magic, it magic should never, ever be too low.
If it happens that it does, it magical parts of it body will fade and disappear. And then the frisk will suffer a brutal death. Due to this, this frisk fears people abusing it weakness to their advantage, due to how life-threatening that weakness is to it.
It should also be mentioned that it should NEVER get too determined for too long or it'll melt. Unless it uses a way around it. Aside from that, all healing towards this frisk is multiplied by 10. [this means Pie can heal this frisk by 1000.]

- **Magic Mastery**
Magic Frisk exceeds in its own magic's capability to construct a move from another one of its own move or through unique methods that makes a move work!

- **Magic Development**
This frisk has multple stages of its magic development, starting from really weak to decent or even powerful.
[FORMING]
6 HP [1 Magic HP, 5 Human HP.]
1 Magic ATK, 1 Magic DEF.
The starting part of its magic, goes as far back as ruins section's starting place.
[BEGINNING]
20 HP [15 Magic HP, 5 Human HP.]
1 Magic ATK, 1 Magic DEF.
Close to snowdin, its Magic HP has increased but still not much use, yet.
[EARLY]
100 HP [95 Magic HP / Lifeforce, 5 Human HP.] (don't mind the sudden addition of 'Lifeforce' to the magic HP part, it's a alternative word to calling it if anything-)
5 Magic ATK, 5 Magic DEF.
Magic ability to use Magic HP as a way of defense to negate damage inbound towards Human HP is unlocked.
Snowdin, this frisk's Magic HP has built up high enough to now be some sort of use, but is still one-shotted by Real Knife unfortunately.
[MIDDLE]
1000 HP [995 Magic HP / Lifeforce, 5 Human HP.]
30 Magic ATK, 30 Magic DEF.
Magic abilities and spells are unlocked at this point on if anything.
Waterfall to hotland, at this point this magic frisk can survive 5 real knife hits and is strong enough to use more of its magic, too.
[LATE]
1500 HP [1495 Magic HP / Lifeforce, 5 Human HP.]
45 Magic ATK, 45 Magic DEF.
Nearing the maximum development before its magic exposure cannot be done anymore to improve its own stats. For that to be achieved would be to defeat ASGORE.
[COMPLETE]
2000 HP [1995 Magic HP / Lifeforce, 5 Human HP]
60 Magic ATK, 60 Magic DEF.
The maximum that its stats can get, from this point on it's at its strongest in magic stats aswell as the point where it has defeated ASGORE. Having achieved the ending that it wanted, which is pacifist. And now lives to help people onwards after it has accomplished one of things it wanted to do.

- **Equalized Tanker**
Magic Frisk can choose whether to defend with Magic HP or to defend with Human HP. As up to this day, this frisk still doesn't know how to dodge with Magic HP properly. It does know how to dodge with Human HP really well though.

###QUOTES:
- " It's time for our resolve to BURN TOGETHER! "
- " I'll bring down the blaze of the spear itself! "

###COMBAT EFFECTIVENESS:
**DIFFICULTY AGAINST IT: [Easy] > [Unforgiving] - Despite having a weakness, it's a overwhelmingly versatile fighter that's very capable of strong counter and strong offense, of which their foes should prepare for a hard battle and hope that its addition of Stranded Magic doesn't cause it to be too determined to lead to its 'Undying' condition.**

- Magic Frisk is capable of many moves with each to their own purposes, making them a hard one to counter completely without using their weakness.
If you are in their hand and you fail to defend yourself in time, you're going to lose quicker.

- While Magic Frisk cannot dodge when defending with Magic HP, it doesn't mean it cannot compensate for it, it can still cast a dash move and dodge it this way. While also being able to tank damage aswell.

- The option of engaging them in close-range is risky due to their close quarters capability.

- Beware of it essence poisoning aswell. If it ever is inflicted on anyone, they should prepare to be crippled.

- If they start to get too determined, they'll start to switch out the magic holding it form together with stranded magic. Which can lead to it gaining up to **3000** total HP and more devastating attack's, despite the magic vent being maximized here! [2995 Magic HP, 5 Human HP.]
Normally otherwise, it would result in them melting. The aftermath's still the same however, even if they have successfully switched out but only when calming down [aftermath of the fight.] or it lasts for too long, then their inside magic would melt instead.

- Magic Frisk's stamina isn't anything special, since it's still normal. So they're still unable to run for too long unlike most others or less.

- It's incapable of proper retreat when it comes to foes that can teleport.

- Keep in mind that this frisk became like this because of revival magic in its own world.

- **Depending on how anyone use this, they can instantly win a fight against it if they figure out its weakness, even mentally affecting it. Although expect that to not work effectively against Post-Magic Frisk. Hollow-Magic Frisk may have similar results.** But should watch out for the fact that due to recent events, it gained a way to fight back against such weakness.



###ABILITIES:
- Magic Frisk is **STACKED** in moves and abilities, having a purpose for most situations, even if it means to prepare for the unexpected.
- Moves here however seems evenly balanced, some being powerful but high magic cost and other kinds of stuff.

**Unique Magic**
Having been brought back like this by revival magic and its learning of its abilities, even having a human part, allowed it to develop it abilities extremely well.

- "Grey Protection Spell" - 
First magic ability obtained by Magic Frisk here.
Can be applied to anyone that it targets, however there can only be one at a time. The target that it casts this upon will have their soul covered with grey coating.
If the said target takes damage, the spell will redirect most of the damage towards Magic Frisk's Magic HP instead.
This can also help Magic Frisk if it were to cast it upon itself, protecting it Human HP from too much damage.

- "Status Protective Spell" -
Magic Frisk could form slightly more white and transparent kind of grey energetic parts around its soul and redirect incoming effects to that layer, especially soul magic, then dispel it after. Second part of third for Magic Frisk to be able to learn 'Soul Magic'.

- "Shining Debuffer" - 
Target type ability, no amount of speed will help you dodge this. Hold one of it hands out, then forming a shining light on it. When it fully disappears. Shockwave will blast [in another words, appear] at the target's position. Inflicting a debuff and a bit of damage to it.
(simplification of this ability: the only way one can avoid this is by interrupting it [by landing a hit] before the shining light fully disappears. which when it does, then it's basically too late and becomes unavoidable from that point on-)
(deals little damage, just smashes a debuff on the target.)
(significance of that debuff is high though in limits, that is if improved on enough.)
(so it can basically smash a debuff like 'Poison' or more.)

- "Shining Buffer" - 
Similar to Shining Debuffer, but the opposite of it effects, heals a bit and inflicts a status buff effect. Basically reverse process. Instead of shockwave happening from it, it's just shockwave going inward. This is also what marked the start of its healing magic.

- "Shining Heal" - 
Magic Frisk holds one of it hands out as a green light appears on it. After 5 seconds of it being active, it'll then flash green for each second, healing the target of the move here. Can target any point of damage on the person to heal first so yes, it can target the biggest wound and start fixing that up first.
1 HP healed per second. [10 for Magic Frisk if self-target.]

- "Complete Heal Wave" -
Magic Frisk holds out both of it hands, green light on both of it hands, then it puts the lights together and after it's active for 5 seconds, the light suddenly flashes and immediately is gone, causing the person it targeted with to be healed better than 'Shining Heal' via healing wave through em, however is more costly and has long cooldown unlike that move.

- "Heavy Magic Projectile" - 
Thanks to the design of "Vortex Shot" created, it can also make one that is more concentrated on the projectile and not cause vortex effect. Even exploding on impact with better form of explosion than vortex projectiles!
Easier to maintain if not way easier to maintain it unlike vortex projectiles. However the con of this move is that it can hardly curve this kind of projectile's course, where as vortex projectile, it can't really curve that one at all. It's way easier to curve dot magic projectiles than those if anything.

- "Magic Barrier" -
Magic Frisk shields itself carefully and slowly with magic massively gathered around itself, cons of this, it has to stop moving completely.
pros of this, really strong defense. good against any attacks that DOESN'T pierce defense. Blue soul attempt on it is expected to automatically fail due to its immobilization.

- "Energy Release" -
Obtained from having to learn Stranded Magic to save a friend, this is the move capable of turning into 'Heavy Outer Pulse' if Magic Frisk is to release massive amounts of it or large even.
Although not as safe as 'Magic Vent', it does allow Magic Frisk to release most if not all energy in span of a second to even instantly.
First way that it has when it comes to dealing with 'Magic Overload'.
*'Energy Release' is basically quicker yet more destructive potential kind of letting magic out, like all at once or something like that.*

- "Magic Vent" -
Safer and even capable of passive effect, letting some magic out or even energy in a constant process, while it takes time, it's better than releasing all of it at once that can lead to explosion of its surroundings.
Second way that it has when it comes to dealing with 'Magic Overload'.
*'Magic Vent' is a safer, more careful kind of letting magic out, but takes time to be fully complete on the purpose.*

- "Magic Reroute" -
Magic Frisk dedicates more of it magic to holding itself together if needed. Although this raises the limit that it magic has to be above to not start dying that is, so beware of that.

- "Magic Retrieval" -
2 Variants of this.
The first one makes use of vortex magic and 'Magic Vent', maximizing the Magic Vent and then using vortex magic to absorb a move's magic remains.
The second variant makes use of the newly made projectile design, 8 magic vent's on it and the projectile being mostly hollow, allowing for magic absorption which will make it bright again.
Those projectiles have slight automation to absorb Magic Frisk's move remains that were used in combat. But once they're full or done with absorption, they then bring it back to Magic Frisk inside and give em the said magic it was holding.
**This allows Magic Frisk to double-cast moves that are possible to easily absorb magic's remains of.** [For example: Pulse, Magic Explosion and such.]
**The second variant can be automatic or passive.**

- "Shining Strike" -
Magic Frisk swings it hand to a direction, sending a short-burst of some sort of magic form, inspiration from reverse-vortex barrier design one. Can quickly get a hit in and start a combo too.

- "Rapid Hit Magic Rotation" -
Activates 'Magic Vent' to maximum and then.. Unleash shining strike in all 4 directions, rotating and constantly performed! Allows for constant damage being dealt to opponents that are at close range. At a cost of constant magic cost AND being more vulnerable to taking damage.

- "Dot Halo" -
Passive for it stick, combats any attempts of the foe trying to take it weapon, be it yanking the weapon back immediately with dot magic around it enough. Or to stun the opponent if it stranded magic fails to stun em.

- "Auto Light Defense" -
Usually passive, however there's a manual method where it can form a light on one of its hand and then store it inside its magical part. The automation part, especially slight usage of it on manual one was required for this one though.
Automatically forms a glow inside magical part up to 3 times, meant for targeting attacks to inflict damage debuff towards. Detonates projectiles but won't be able to detonate heavy projectiles or especially large or bigger projectiles. Unless they explode on impact.

- "Magic Dash" -
Magic Frisk makes use of recoil knockback to launch itself in a direction in order to dodge a attack. Be mindful of the amount of magic or energy remaining though. Using several in short amount of time is going to be too draining for it. Even then, only a few can be used per battle there. Make them count.

- "Loaded Shot" -
Charges up and then saves the move for later, firing a sudden heavy magic projectile when time calls for it.

- "Overcharged Beam [Miniature]" -
It starts off with a startup.. Then a sudden burst of light occurs, not as bright.. Then it then fires off a quick powerful beam.
A move turned into a weapon.

- "Overcharged Beam" -
Magic Frisk charges up through a startup charge, then soon after, a bright burst of light happens before it immediately fires off a large to massive, really powerful beam.
Getting hit directly by a non-miniature move usually leads to the target being crippled so in another words, dodging it is completely advised.
Might aswell watch out for potential effects that beam can inflict too.
Non-miniature one has high stranded magic cost if it is to make use of that, so it has to be determined enough if anything atleast, being a bit out of it safe limits is the miniature one, when it can do something like 'Energy Release' being turned into 'Heavy Outer Pulse' though, THEN it can do this.

- **SOUL MAGIC:**
Recent new category learnt by Magic Frisk, allowing it to temporarily modify target's soul or its own's soul to change their way of dodging, or even change strategies completely!

- "Shining Soul Magic" - 
Holding both of its hands out, white light appearing on each and then immediately clap them together! Due to it being a target type ability, upon successful cast, it turns the target's soul grey!
When a soul's in that state. During attacks, the soul tends to fade and they'll have to collide with attacks that aren't too much for em to 'absorb and make the soul more visible' again.
However. If they get too much, they explode.
If their soul fully fades, they also explode too.
Heavy damage, but the soul magic effect automatically wears off if the target's soul explodes.
Magic Frisk can cast this upon itself so it can absorb some weak projectiles to not take damage sometimes too.
Although keeping this move active would be draining for Magic Frisk to keep it going for longer, so usually this move can't last long.

- **DOT MAGIC:**
Those attacks are small, speedy and capable of curving. For a basic magic attack tool, those can destroy stamina quickly. Especially its first attack move. Can be blocked since it's better than tanking and not destroyed for it.

- "Basic Attack" - 
Magic Frisk summons a small magic projectile, that in the shape of a dot with a trail. Requires no hand movement. So don't even think making the frisk stuck there would stop it here.

- "Medium Gathering Strike" - 
Magic Frisk forms constant small magic projectiles and gathers them up to form a medium magic projectile, before then firing it. Can manually split off into small magic projectiles at any moment too. 

- "Large Gathering Strike" - 
Same process as above, but large magic projectile.

- "Dot Sphere" - 
Special move if the process is to be kept going. Unleashes a dot sphere on the target, giving them a terrible time especially with stray dot projectile being sent everywhere. Hardly dodgeable.

- **VORTEX MAGIC:**
This magic category's usually draining for Magic Frisk here, hence it doesn't really use it often.. But if it has to, well, it will.

- "Vortex Shot" - 
Magic projectile with some sort of energetic short sawblade, however unleashing vortex particles around itself that can throw projectiles around. Especially causing dot magic projectiles to go in unpredictable directions. Can be thrown up to 2 of those in one attack or move, however maintaining the vortex effects will drain it magic constantly, so it's recommended to not have those out for too long.
Considered to be magic frisk's heavy magic attack.

- "Reverse-Vortex Barrier" -
Magic Frisk gets ready.. Then after having it hands crossing each other, swing them outward to form a strangely-formed magic infront of itself that tends to repell incoming attacks away, including it own though. Drains magic constantly till the barrier disappears though. So use it wisely.

- "Piercing Accelerator" -
Magic Frisk makes use of vortex magic to accelerate it, and then immediately makes it disappear to launch the said projectile. With slight usage of vortex magic again to make sure it's correctly aimed too.
If boosted by stranded magic, completely pierces through block's or even instant killing shield's if anything that is.
It makes use of 2 vortex projectiles, one for orbit. the other for acceleration, the accelerator-role vortex projectile then moves around the orbit-role one, making sure it never goes offcourse till too much acceleration is applied to it.

- "Magic Hurricane" -
Makes use of the vortex projectiles along with unleashing large amounts of small magic projectiles, maybe throw in a few heavy magic projectiles there as a bonus. Then takes all surrounding's attacks and brings them into the hurricane attack, strengthening it even further. Deals rapid damage and such due to this, devastating if used right.
**Considered as a special attack.**
**This is also draining for the Magic Frisk here too, especially more than usual the longer this goes on. Use with caution.**

- **PULSE MAGIC:**
This magic's useful for taking care of invading objects or even blasting your point-blank range foes to oblivion with this AoE move. Although had some risk at same time aswell.

- "Magic Explosion" -
This move was learnt during the process of trying to learn Pulse Magic in 2 parts, due to this move being representation of the failed process. This usually happens if Magic Frisk isn't careful with some types of pulses. Inflicts self-damage along with damaging surroundings aswell.
**Reminder that Magic Frisk CAN use this as a weapon and CAN use it to fully self-destruct itself to nuke its surroundings.**

- "Inner Pulse" -
Kinda self-explanatory, it grey parts flashes throughout its body like a sort of pulse, even going through human parts of it and not taking much damage from it. Either utilizing vortex magic partially for the process or other kinds of results used in this.
Anything from roots going inside, any planted invading device inside or even invasive magic can be pulse'd in effort to destroy the said invasive element.
There are pros and cons to this though, for one, never try to destroy stranded magic with stranded magic-boosted inner pulse since it's better off using something that doesn't have possibility in theory of accidently causing results worse if it did this.
Potential benefit though is that it might be able to turn this move into a way of destroying magic flow blockade, although that might have to be calculated about later.
You CAN potentially kill a creature that tries to burrow inside with this too.
And it can be combo'd with Magic Vent to further help with getting invasive elements out.

- "Outer Pulse" -
Magic Frisk forms slight magic barrier around itself and then performing 'Magic Explosion', but more controlled outside itself.. Mostly as if magic barrier shot out the explosion while protecting itself from it.
The magic barrier part is to negate self-damage a lot, atleast enough to be insignificant.
However, it surroundings in turn gets blasted. Now imagine if you were hit by this at point-blank range, not only that but this move is efficient at this too.

- "Charge Pulse" -
Similar to inner pulse, except the moment the pulse reached the edge or border of itself, the erupting pulse escaped outside thanks to 'Magic Vent' and few other supporting moves. No self-damage, but less damage than outer pulse. Basically 1-Burst Pulse.

- "Burst Pulse" -
Similar to previous one.. But instead of grey parts flashing white as pulse spreaded throughout once, it was 5 times, gathering up at border or edge of itself [probably awarding it outline glow.], till then..
And then what do ya know, the magic frisk's surroundings just suddenly exploded in energetic, magic explosion process. More of a pulse though, but now it really is powerful, stronger than the outer pulse variation.
Looks devastating too if anyone were to be caught being hit by it at point-blank.
Although the drawback of this move pretty much became clear quickly since it gets 'stunned', as in collapsed after draining itself slightly or more doing this move. Before getting back up atleast seconds later after doing this.

- "Inner Soul Pulse" -
Self-explanatory. 1 out of 3 parts needed to be able to perform 'Soul Magic'. Similar to Inner Pulse, but performed on its own soul.

- "Outer Soul Pulse" -
Self-explanatory. Not required for 'Soul Magic'. Similar to Outer Pulse, but performed on its own soul.

- "Soul Magic Dispel" -
Modified variant of inner soul pulse to revert its soul to normal from soul magic conditions. Just a grey to white pulse throughout its own soul for how the move looks, nothing else.

**CONTINUATION IN ABILITIES PART 2.**


Continuation of this magic here. If it wasn't self-explanatory enough.

- "Shining Burst" -
Despite its can-be-draining properties, it's a dangerous move to be hit by. Usually a automatic move, up to one at a time loaded to be quick-performed.
On cast, it's a target type ability, a immediate shockwave at target's positions, forming the small lights that flashes once, then already being invisible after the light flash and then blowing up.
However that is accompanied by a second shockwave, inward. Depending on variations, the invisible lights may or may not get drawn towards. If it gets drawn towards, it's going to be thrown into surrounding areas before exploding. If not, the usual.
There are 3 variations to this. First one is the one with light's flash being bright, meaning it's not as light as second variant, which means it'll explode target's position.
Second one is the light's flash being less brighter, or not that bright in this case. This means it'll explode target's surrounding areas.
Third one is a quick one, it's only one shockwave and the light's are bright, immediately blowing up quickly. The only difference between this and the other two's is that the light's fades quicker, so beware.

- "Shining Effect Wipe" -
Magic Frisk holds a open hand out, plam side facing forward, then a shining light appears and quickly flashes, eliminating only one debuff selected from the target. The targets soul having flashed grey at same time too.
It IS draining to keep using this though, so it only considers using this when fulfilling support role by healing and status effects.

- "Sparkling Shine" -
A move completely incapable of combat, but good for creating good scenery. Magic Frisk holds out one of its hands, or even have a finger do it instead. When active, it'll emit sparkling particles. and the slight flame effect that decays quick aswell when using draw variation. Why flame effect? To make it look nicer atleast.
Really customizable though, particles can be made to last longer or fade in and out from time to time and such.
Can be turned into "Sparkling Draw', where the particles will last as long as possible and the slight flame-like particles makes its appearance in that variation.

- "Bouncing Piercer" -
Introduces the 'Armed' property of the move where magic builds up on part of its body there, which is one of its hand in this case, basically aims a hand forward and if it's armed already, fire off a magic bouncing piercer! Projectile design of it being that it has slight magic barrier at the front that's held together by the magic structure part, while still exploding if it couldn't pierce through or can't bounce off of it!
Bounces if it fails to pierce and is angled enough to do it, otherwise explode!
It does look sharp though, like it's a short rod with sharp end.
The explosions those projectiles create are small due to being 'Bouncing' and 'Piercing' type together, unfortunately.
**Medium Magic Cost though, so try to not use too many of those. At maximum of 5, although to be safe, only try atleast 1 or 2 of those projectiles to remain efficient.**

- "Cannon Dance" -
Aim with a hand while building up charge in both hands, form a quick magic barrier and immediately release the charge through it, then outer pulse through that. Firing a quick variant of magic cannon with knockback that then causes it to step back, and aim with other one and so it repeats!

- "Magic Lockdown" -
Automatic passive ability, this usually mostly activates when Magic Frisk loses a limb or magic leak occurs, where it will close off a magic flow or as the name suggests, 'Lockdown' a section to prevent it. Allowing for stable magic flow while fighting, even when heavily injured!

- "Homing Sense Incorporation" -
Makes use of Magic sense, but in the kind of homing that those projectiles with this becomes long ranged homing projectiles, but can easily be tricked by magic flares stuff as long as the target's move has more magic than the user.
Can be used on any attack, but not the most efficient due to dot magic usage on a move to make it 'homing' here.

- "Automated Emergency Magic Defense" -
A passive magic move made by Magic Frisk with purpose of activating if Magic Frisk were to ever get knocked out, where its magic's automation would take over.

- **SOUL MAGIC [Page 2]:**

- **DOT MAGIC [Page 2]:**

- "Homing Capability" - Useless for now or just not as efficient, Magic Frisk forms some small magic projectiles that can curve inside its own projectiles that it's forming. The cons here however overwhelms the pros, unfortunately.

- **VORTEX MAGIC [Page 2]**

- **PULSE MAGIC [Page 2]:**

- **REVIVAL MAGIC:**
Yes, i'm serious. Magic Frisk is starting to be more capable of Revival Magic slowly over time. Although that can't go without consequences for the full revival magic usage here.

- " Magic Patch " - Lost a limb? No problem, just grab it and fix it up before you drop dead aswell. By attaching it back on through magic vent method and reconstructing some parts of the targeted part, assuming that it isn't gone yet.

**ADVANTAGE:**

- First of all, this magic's multipurpose as HECK.

- Second of all, this magic can be efficient and can be enhanced with stranded magic as long as it works, as ALL HECK.

- Third of all, this magic has massive advantage of moves construction.

- Fourth of all, EVERY SINGLE MOVES FULFILLS THEIR PURPOSES TO ALL HELL!

- FIFTH OF ALL, IT EXCEEDS IN- You get it basically. Magic Frisk exceeds in magic. And it has over 30 moves in this.

**DISADVANTAGE:**

- Suffers a massive disadvantage if up against Magic Frisk's weakness.

- Most moves if not all of it seems to be equal to each other due to consequences, capabilities and all. No powerful low-cost attacks basically.

- For what it makes up in massive multipurpose capability is that it tends to have trouble using those moves in other situations than they are meant for.

**PROCESS:**

- This unique magic cannot be learnt by others.

**Stranded Magic up next in Abilities Part 3.**




**Stranded Magic**
_Requires Magic Frisk to be determined enough for proper use._

Obtained during it first time of stopping BW Chara's Overload due to being determined to save them, this magic is proven to be really useful to this frisk. Allowing it to pierce through defense and blow up a area.
**If this frisk ever breaks mentally beyond repair, this frisk's stranded magic is going to be buffed.**
**This can literally be applied to any kinds of moves from Unique Magic, as long as Magic Frisk finds a way to make it work that is. Beware of the results though.**

- **FORMABLE MAGIC:**
  These moves are in there first priority if it can be formed without help of this frisk's magical stick.
- "Resistance Shift" -
  Gain increased resistance towards a energy type or such, if high enough in progression, it becomes choosing of either magic or physical.
  Can increase it resistance against a status effect if it doesn't wish to increase it against magic or physical.
- "Magical Relocation" -
Toggleable ability discovered first by Magic Frisk, activates everytime it takes damage. Upon activation, going stealth and invisible for 5 seconds while also dropping out of magic sense's radar! However this can be extended and be turned into another move, being mentioned below here:
- "Magic Cloak" -
Good transition required for it to succeed here:
Release a LOT of magic and have it be stored elsewhere where it could absorb it back when it's done being near-invisible. So they basically just become faint magic atleast close to death there.
in another words, they're [almost] the first one to fully cloak with using magic.
The flower on Magic Frisk could make a great use for storing all that magic, though, allowing Magic Frisk to release magic and store it in there at the moment.
- "Magic Flare" -
  Can be done by the stick or by it hand, deploys a bright projectile that just floats and drifts away in a direction. But immediately explodes when a projectile gets near it, flinging it offcourse, can be done constantly for more of those things to protect itself completely from that direction.
- "Magic Mine" -
  Magic Flare's alternate variant, those actually have damaging detonations if anything.
- "Magic AoE Mine" -
  Magic Mine's one of variants, less damage but more AoE radius, good for catching dodging people.
- "Cone Barrier" -
  Required with magic flare to be fully effective, this cone barrier rapidly spins, changing it middle point and requiring a precise attack that would miss the frisk to be able to destroy it effectively. Having it open hand out forward deploys this.
- "Upgraded Move" -
  Makes use of stranded magic to enhance one of Magic Frisk's Magic Set. It cannot lead back to stranded magic itself though.
  Has special interactions with some moves too.
- "Magical Firework" - Mostly mood-helping type, forms a projectile with design that of a firework, then fire it and watch the customizable sparkling particles scatter!
Making use of stranded magic and unique magic here.
- "Magic Sense" -
  Anti-Ambush tool, but can also be used like a radar to find where others are at.
- "Magic Sonar Wave" -
  'Whatever you detect, detects you aswell.' Makes use of Magic Sense partially and Unique Magic aswell to do this move.
  2 Variations,
  All-Around - Less range, but goes in all directions.
  Directional - More range but less directions.
  it sends out magic boosted by stranded magic as a wave, which reveals itself immediately, but does the same to whoever's caught by it too. Since it can be traced, but also traces whoever it gets to. Basically makes use of 'Magic Sense' and attempts to incorporate it into the magic sent out there, and returns the wave back after it gets something.
  The magic sent out are also partially main magic to be able to come back to it user if anything-
  It holds it hand out and have it open, then it performs the magic wave there, it can also hold it out forward and do the other variation instead, which is cone-direction instead of all-around.
  **Long to Very-Long Ranged Move for Detection.**
- "Lightful Shot" -
  Light attack. Both ways, literal and in attack type term. It holds it hand out and unleashes a bright projectile that can do medium damage but goes in a straight line, can be constantly fired.
- "Touch Denial" -
  Can be passive or not. Makes use of stranded magic to have them be at the edge of itself, however 'Magic Vent' will be disabled if it does this, gains a outline in the process.
  However allows for quick-performing 'Outer Pulse' kind of move, except it would be full of stranded magic damage if anything.
- "Second Strike" -
  Uses it free hand to swipe it while rapidly producing 'Lightful Shot' projectiles, which decays fast but can immediately explode if it hits the target.
- "Charged Weapon" -
  Magic Frisk charges some stranded magic into the weapon.. Then it can be used at will! Making it do more damage while also causing AoE explosion aswell.
  The red trail also going further out as a wave for it AoE.
- "Flaring Minelayer" -
  Gather up small magic projectiles and then store magic mines in it, then launch the magic projectile construct forward as it scatters magic mines as it travels!
- "Burst Shot" -
  Heavy Magic Projectiles, fired 3 times in a burst!
- "Leaf Formation" -
  Forms a leaf projectile without the requirement of the stick, however the stick being imbued in magic allows for enhanced properties, likely.
- "Leaf Ground Control" -
  Form leaves to fly around scattering stranded magic particles on the ground, purpose being to prevent ground-based attacks from succeeding or just damaging anyone underground.
- "Ground Wave" -
Magic Frisk hits the ground either by stomp or such, sending out a wave of stranded magic that can detonate at any moment, allowing for attacks from below or other ways this can be utilized in.
- "Overload Beam" -
  Similar to overcharged beam, however this one primarily relies on stranded magic in case of situations where stranded magic is too much for the frisk. A massive burst of red light at first, before firing a devastating beam that can cripple almost anybody that it hits.
  A special move to say the least.

- **STICK MAGIC:**
  These moves are in this category if they require magical stick to work effectively, either that or it cannot be simply formed without its stick's help.
- "Leaf Wave" -
  Waves the stick, unleashing leaf attacks this way.
- "Stick Staff" -
  Charged weapon's special interaction, forms lightful projectile on end of the stick and then makes it as if it made it stick melee-capable aswell!
- "Orb Splash" -
  It gets ready... Then slams the weapon on the ground, the projectile hitting first for it to suddenly scatter across the ground similar to liquid, but full of stranded magic!
- "Stick-Assisted Accelerator" -
  Vortex magic's smaller but makes use of the projectile, then makes it stronger with stranded magic, and then literally shoots it with stranded magic too, making for a powerful railgun-like move.
  It points the weapon forward, then the charging process can begin.
  Still makes use of 2 vortex projectiles but smaller, charged with stranded magic and disappears really fast upon forming to fire, since it'll be flicked to high vortex speed effect before immediately vanishing to fire the projectile. the stick assisting it with stranded magic to send it even faster.
  Upon firing it, it gets knocked back, but the projectile's sent at extreme speeds, guaranteeing any block kills or even shield kills. or even piercing through it instantly!
  Although the payload of this must be a small projectile or it won't be at extreme speeds.
  Deals Pulse AoE damage to it surroundings after firing it, though.
  **More efficient than doing this completely with normal or unique magic though.**
- "Magic Cannon" -
  Points it stick forward, rapid build up to the front of the stick, with magic barrier around it to form the barrel.. Close the entrance to it [but atleast leaving a small hole for the recoil reduction-] and then fire it!
  It gets sent back slightly after firing it, but that projectile is powerful and can even explode in a large explosion or so if anything.
- "Crossbow: Cluster" -
  Load a leaf, making use of stranded magic to power the thing and all.. With main magic mixed in for the crossbow design.. Then it can now start loading stuff in after or it can fire if already loaded, with dot magic's small magic projectiles around the leaf to serve as additional payload! Triggering the payload manually doesn't disrupt the leaf projectile if anything.
- "Crossbow: Heavy" - Load a leaf, then give it some lightful shot projectile with slight dot magic to hold it. Then shoot it and watch as getting a direct hit on enemies can lead to them getting heavy damage instead of medium.
- "Crossbow: Advanced Guide" - Load a leaf, then give it couple of dot magic projectiles to make it better on being guided or homing if it was one. And if it wasn't, it just turns it into a guided projectile or homing.
- "Stick-Assisted Forcefield' / 'Lightening Forcefield" -
  Rain spreading particles from above! Point it stick up, and start forming a wide constant-regenerating forcefield that protects itself and any of it allies within it.

**CONTINUATION IN ABILITIES PART 4.**



Continuation of stranded magic moveset here.

- **FORMABLE MAGIC:**
  These moves are in there first priority if it can be formed without help of this frisk's magical stick.
- "DT Exhaust" -
Helped to be constructed by EM Frisk:
Rapidly emit DT around itself, requiring Magic Vent to be fully open to be done so, but can rapidly lower it. Leaves it open to offguard blows though but can recover rapidly.
- "DT Support-Incorporate" -
Helped to be constructed by EM Frisk:
With use of DT from anyone that transfers it to it, it then incorporates it into a point to form a attack. Only works with other's stranded magic though.
Unique magic and its wandering magic is used here. [Strange for wandering magic to be here.. Till you realize the output is stranded magic.]
- "DT Bolts" -
Helped to be constructed by EM Frisk:
Fires out multple short bursts of stranded magic as projectiles, good for having alternatives to 'Lightful Shots' that are cost-effective and fast.
- "**The Blaze of The Spear Itself**" -
As the name suggests, Magic Frisk after charging large amounts of magic into its two-ended magic spear's tip, says something along the line of 'I will bring down the blaze of the spear itself!' before spinning around once having it concentrated into one singular violent vertical slash down, despite leaving itself vulnerable from the said spin, if it hits, expect its kill effect to be splitting the opponent in half vertically. Blocking it is possible to avoid being instant killed, but you'd probably be crippled if it manages to hit.
**Cannot be used unless it is far enough in Stranded Magic's Soul Stage.**
**This special attack can still continue even after it has been hit during it.**

- **GUN MAGIC:**
These moves are in this category if they require the gun to work effectively aswell, just like how Stick Magic is described. Magic Frisk seems to imbue its physical gun with magic though when doing those. May be making use of Stranded Magic to fire those shots.
- "Red bullet" -
Can form a red, determined bullet.
but only weak form of it when it's not determined that is.
However, even weak form of it tho can break a tree though.
- "Capturing Bullet" -
Forms a different form of magic bullet, this one has combination of Stranded and Unique Magic to be able to do this, stranded for the capability to capture larger projectiles and unique magic to help with redirecting the direction to fire it off to.
- "Connected Bullet" -
Different form of magic bullet aswell, utilizes more of unique magic, stranded magic and wandering magic, however has slower speed but more area denial capability. If more than one of those bullets are active at a time, those would connect with each other and cause a whole line of area denial inbetween it.
- "Piercing Bullet" -
A wandering magic form of magic bullet, made for piercing through opponent's shields or barriers. Especially defenses.
- "Orbit Bullet" -
Requires further soul stage of wandering magic to be usable.
A special kind of magic bullet with wandering magic projectiles that was purposed to orbit around the bullet, this in exchange meant hat the magic bullet itself is slower but both the bullet and orbiting orbs have stranded magic aswell.
- "Launch Bullet" -
Magic Dash's alternative, although unable to change its trajectory mid-air without it and may inflict slight self damage if done in extremely quick succession. Besides that, it makes use of stranded magic heavily for knockback launch, although can use wandering magic when it has 'Soul Ignition' going and is in further soul stage of it.
- "Charge Bullet" -
Heavy use of Unique Magic and Stranded Magic, takes a bit of time or such to set it up, but when done, spin the chamber to then immediately charge up one charged magic bullet from how many magic bullets were loaded into it before firing it straight at the opponent.
- "Hypersonic Bullet" -
Full on Stranded Magic for mass velocity and charge-up from Wandering Magic for the build of the bullet that can handle such speeds. Unique magic for automation and allowing it to guarantee a immediate hit when successful or not interrupted. Deadly kind of attack.

- **PAN MAGIC:**
These moves are in this category if they require the pan to work effectively aswell, similar to Stick Magic too.
- "Flung Sphere" -
Encase it with slight wandering magic, and as it hits it with the pan like a baseball bat, the wandering magic would shatter and the sphere goes flying as a stranded magic attack.
- "Pan Shotgun" -
Form a sphere, toss it up and slam it with the pan and watch as bunch of small long lasers goes everywhere forward, stranded magic type projectiles.
- "Defense Reinforce" -
Similar to wandering magic variation, reinforce it with stranded magic, unfortunately while not as effective, it does actually work really well if it could throw on medium to large amounts of stranded magic onto it. Makes it hit harder aswell as a result.

- **SHOES MAGIC**
These moves are in this category if they require the ballet shoes to work effectively aswell, similar to Stick Magic too.
- "Imbued Kick" -
Magic Frisk imbues the shoes with stranded or wandering magic, if stranded, AoE impact effect, if wandering, direct hit will hurt more. This can be used with any kind of kick type attack to work.

- **BOOK MAGIC:**
These moves are in this category if they require the torn notebook to work effectively aswell, similar to Stick Magic too.
- "Book Shockwave" -
Open the book, then snap it closed suddenly for stranded magic shockwave to course throughout the air.

- **GLOVES MAGIC:**
These moves are in this category if they require the tough gloves to work effectively aswell, similar to Stick Magic too.
- "Explosive Strikes" -
Imbue the tough gloves with stranded magic for AoE potential.
- "Piercing Strikes" -
Imbue the tough gloves with wandering magic for Piercing potential.

- **KNIFE MAGIC:**
These moves are in this category if they require any form of knives to work effectively aswell, similar to Stick Magic too.
- "Explosive Slash" -
Good for when imbued onto toy knife, upon successful hit, the stranded magic on it would suddenly erupt and cause a strong impact. Can stack however, allowing for 'Burst Slash 1' and so on.
- "Blazing Cutter" -
Similar to bringing down the blaze of the spears itself type move, it charges up by imbuing the knife with more magic, be it stranded or wandering and then slash, the magic concentrated onto the said slash here.
- "Blade Mine" -
Magic Frisk releases the charge of stranded magic on the knife in the form of a formed blade that floats there, allowing for suddenly deflecting the person's weapon away or exploding them in general when hit. May inflict recoil damage though if it were to do this without a defense in mind.

- **STICK MAGIC:**
  These moves are in this category if they require magical stick to work effectively, either that or it cannot be simply formed without its stick's help.
- "Leaf Wave" -
  Waves the stick, unleashing leaf attacks this way.

**ADVANTAGE:**

- Really strong magic when staying to its trait, has multple soul stages and can even be powerful enough to wreck havoc.
- Can be multipurpose by some slight form and can be mixed with its unique magic!
- Exceeds in Guard-Breaking and AoE capabilities!
- Capable of paralyzing the opponents if they attempt to interact with its soul by grabbing or such, even a lot to know about it!

**DISADVANTAGE:**

- Magic Frisk will melt if they stay too determined for too long, suffering loss in DEF first, then ATK and then SPD, before completely melting. They CAN become an amalgamate. Although it can be delayed by using stranded magic to maintain the magical parts, but melting on the inside CAN occur in that case instead.
- Doesn't rely on reducing the opponent's options too much for what DT Class Stranded Magic can do.
- Ultimately, its out of luck if it wants to use this off the bat. Its soul stages are mostly achieved through being in higher danger.
- This magic has serious consequences. Multple to list here.

**PROCESS:**

- Stay true to your trait.

**ETC:**

- This is stranded magic, made by 'Friendly' here, so credits to em if anything.




**Wandering Magic**
*Requires Magic Frisk to be determined enough for proper use.*

- **FORMABLE MAGIC:**
  These moves are in there first priority if it can be formed without help of this frisk's magical stick.
- “Sphere Attack” -
Magic Frisk holds one of its hands out forward, arming their magic as its left hand's clutched, then opening it to fire a sphere attack!
This seems to be its wandering magic's basic attack too.
- "Movable Shield Block" -
Magic Frisk holds out one of its hands forward, materializing a defensive block of a shield, with structures to be attached to the hand! Allowing for directional defense!
The disadvantage of this though is that it's hard to move it up or down, making it more vulnerable to be hit from above or below.
- "Circular Directional Shield" -
Not as great as the previous but a start to Magic Frisk forming a ability that can absorb attacks and dish it out at the foes.
The more this shield takes in, the stronger its counter-attack will be.
Beware of the potential disadvantages though as it's only meant for absorbing blows and dishing out attacks from the said absorption. It's not 'Movable Shield Block'. So don't even try doing that on a attack way above this move's level.
- "Magic Freeze" -
Magic Frisk grabs the foe, then send wandering magic wave through supported by Unique Magic's Pulse Magic, immobilizing them by freezing their legs via attaching to the ground and opening them up to a combo!
- "Thin Ray" -
Magic Frisk holds a hand out, then a thin ray is blasted as it immediately swipes it before the thin ray stops firing!
This move cannot do much damage but it can cause troubles by magic block effects.
- "Multi-Detonate Shot" -
To prepare this move, magic frisk would have magic build up on one arm, face one of its hands towards the opponent, clutched and then open it to fire a shot with layering of stranded magic at first, then wandering magic as second for piercing and another stranded magic layer as last!
- "Magic Equipment Creation" -
[SPEAR CREATION:]
Magic Frisk closes its hands together and then start to move both of the hands really slowly outward, forming something till it ends up seeming like a spear with tip on both ends.
Really straining for it though in magic cost, since it costs most of its entire magic, but in exchange, it gets a reliable magic weapon that it can use if anything!
Has some stranded magic outline layer around the weapon too so a hit from one tip would cause slight [aoe] explosion. Although costs a bit of magic to recharge that explosion part there.
Magic Frisk can split the double-ended spear in the middle, allowing it to dual-wield if needed with each's handle ends being capable of short boost when needed. Though would have to be reloaded each time it's used unfortunately despite the advantages from this process.
*This DOES NOT mean it cannot create things like magic armor for itself and such. This has been done once to have some sort of armor equipment to protect its human part of the head.*
[LASSO CREATION:]
Similar process, cost and such as previous, but making the lasso instead of that magic spear.
The lasso is capable of expanding and retracting, especially with automatic functions to prevent accidents, being made as a restricting tool. It has magic dash function for immediate wrap if it were to start unwrapped, though would need to be recharged upon using it.
Capable of restraining foes limbs or movements.
Hard to break, too due to having wandering magic in it.
[RUBBER BAND CREATION:]
Similar process as previous and such, but making rubber band design instead of lasso. Can retract in extremely quick succession, Can work as surprise restraining tool. Can also readjust which portions of the foe's body has a higher chance of being restrained too, though the faint effect caused to them will remain the same.
[STICK CREATION:]
The easiest process out of the rest, similar as previous though, but making stick design. While not as effective as using imbued stick for magic, it does do its job, though the unique aspect of it is that Magic Frisk can slam it on a foe to shatter the said magical stick and stun them for a bit. Then follow up with another attack shortly after.
- "Enhanced Magic Lockdown" -
Now with wandering magic, it can lockdown specific areas way better!
- "Throwing Spear" -
Magic Frisk forms a magical spear, and then suddenly fire it by throwing, pierces first and gets stuck mid-process, then explodes from the inside from there while also inflicting both effects!
Leaves behind a lasting field too.
*Counts as Medium Magic Attack, makes use of Stranded Magic and Wandering Magic here. Spammable due to being able to form it quick but also magic efficient in terms of direct hit attacks that goes in a straight line.*
- "Wandering Magic Spread" -
Charge up wandering magic at tip of the stick, then use stranded magic to suddenly send wandering magic particles everywhere in a straight cone!
- "Magic Slide" -
For when more dodge's required during a dash maneuver, this would be the move that does it! Till it ends up facing prediction attacks of course.
*Could be effective as this allows Magic Dash on lower scale to change directions slightly.*
- "Magic-Assisted Climb" -
Make use of wandering magic to hold onto what it's climbing on better, especially with better grip too on the object. Takes a short while or longer though to complete.
- "Magic Platform" -
Form a platform of wandering magic!
*Beware of medium to heavy magic cost, however.*
- "Defense Slammer" -
Basically a move similar in arming as 'Bouncing Piercer', the difference though is that it doesn't bounce, but rather, it's a long rod projectile sent at high speeds by use of stranded magic, although could also be thrown and fired that way if needed.
it's also a complete counter to anyone trying to block this or using forcefields since it's literally going to drill a hole into the foe's defense.
The con of this is that it has higher magic cost, doesn't explode and it has longer arming time than 'Bouncing Piercer'. Especially when it can overpierce.
It is most effective in situations where all other moves of Magic Frisk can't break through the defense on bright side though.
- "Supersonic Dot" -
Slightly larger variant of small magic projectile, made mostly for when engaging at long ranges or when precisely striking incredibly fast foes. Held together by wandering magic while making use of stranded magic for initial propulsion.
Can potentially be at medium magic cost though or atleast inbetween light and medium cost.
- "Magic Incorporate" -
Magic Frisk would have one of its hand out towards a direction, then release some magic, whether it be unique, stranded or wandering. With purpose of incorporating it onto a ongoing attack or move. Boosting it basically if anything, though on a permanent object, this boost is unfortunately temporary but decent for being a support move.
Second variant is a 'shining' move. 'Shining Incorporate', takes longer but can snipe-support a move if not interrupted.
- "Imbued Ground Conduct" -
Magic Frisk combines both stranded magic and wandering magic to do concentrated magic that travels till it hits something, then wandering magic will draw in the whole thing towards the target that was hit and blast it.
- "Imbued Field" -
A ball of wandering magic, if not, atleast a orb of it. With concentrated stranded magic point at the center, if the ball hits a target though, it will suddenly fling the red glow point over and explode the target along with the entire attack to direct all the damage towards.
The said ball of magic's wandering magic is barely visible due to the amounts, but usually enough to push all the stranded magic when it triggers. Also making use of unique magic.
- "Artillery Arc Lightful Shot" -
Basically lightful shot but it's affected by gravity, useful for artillery shots.
With the green projectile, shooting it with red projectile can knock it to that direction by Magic Frisk's choice.
- "Raindown Projectile" -
Form a circle and then charge it with enough magic before tossing it up and having it auto redirect itself to moving forward to rain down small projectiles downward on the way as it goes! Can be either stranded or wandering magic.
- "**Shielded Rainfall**" -
Mix of imbued ground conduct and raindown projectile.
Magic Frisk first forms movable shield block, then causes particles shockwave spread throughout the ground, stranded and wandering magic, the stranded magic particles then detonates to send wandering magic shockwave all the way up to one singular point, which is above magic frisk, and then, rains barrage of fire down around itself including itself aswell, While it has lifted its movable shield block up fully to block it, then slam it back down and fire off a quick follow up if it wanted to, aswell.
- "**Overpiercing Castastrophe**" -
Ult-scale if not atleast a special attack where Magic Frisk forms a projectile and charges stranded magic into it along with wandering magic before throwing it, sending it everywhere as it bounces off from one spot to another. This also has the maximum control from Magic Frisk, through some amount of unique magic too to make sure. Have fun breaking through DEF with this! ...At a cost of large to massive amounts of magic of course.
- "**Rapid Fire Redirection**" -
Just as the name says, it fires a barrage of magic projectiles, however if one of them hits, each projectile's unique magic and wandering magic will push it and crash into the opponent at same time aswell. Can only redirect once though.
- "**Repulse: Freed from Combat [Counter]**" -
Magic Frisk's first ult-scale move, first variant.
Occurs when the opponent slams enough attacks into its wandering magic defense and not broken yet from absorption of it. And if it's enough to spend the whole magic load gained from it.
Then the next time Magic Frisk notices the opponent trying to melee it, it'll immediately counter by blocking it suddenly with its double-ended magic spear to stun them and then throw them into a cutscene.
Magic Frisk would then slam the opponent back with that said double-ended magic spear. Sending the opponent into a beam attack that then sends them into another beam attack and so on for a bit. Before throwing it back to Magic Frisk which would be about to strike them with Upgraded Dagger maxed on magic to have the opponent learn how it would feel like to be struck with essence poisoning, bleeding damage and heavy damage. Along with magic block effect on top.
- "**Repulse: Freed from Combat [Attack]**" -
Magic Frisk's first ult-scale move, second variant.
This move is only usable when Magic Frisk has too much stranded magic.
If the opponent is hit ONCE by its double-ended magic spear, wandering magic will be made use of to stun them and then magic frisk will throw them into a cutscene.
Instead of beams however, it will be leaf attacks slamming into the opponent constantly till the opponent is thrown back to Magic Frisk and vice versa, the full-magic upgraded dagger is used again like the counter variation's last part.

- **STICK MAGIC:**
  These moves are in this category if they require magical stick to work effectively, either that or it cannot be simply formed without its stick's help.
- "Armored Stick" -
Wandering magic around the stick as a layer! Toggleable.
- "Particle leftover sweep" - With wandering magic version of stranded magic moves, spread particles everywhere, and now with use of stick, swipe the particles up to raise them and use them to block or strike its opponents that way!
*This can be done with Stranded Magic kind too.*
*This also requires the said magic to be high enough to perform such moves like that.*




Continuation of wandering magic moveset here.

- **FORMABLE MAGIC:**
  These moves are in there first priority if it can be formed without help of this frisk's magical stick.


- **GUN MAGIC:**
These moves are in this category if they require the gun to work effectively aswell, just like how Stick Magic is described. Magic Frisk seems to imbue its physical gun with magic though when doing those. May be making use of Stranded Magic to fire those shots.


- **PAN MAGIC:**
These moves are in this category if they require the pan to work effectively aswell, similar to Stick Magic too.

- "Defense Reinforce" -
Makes use of wandering magic to reinforce the pan, allowing it to endure blows better, especially good against any overpowered physical bullets here! Also causing it to hit harder as a result, although harder to attack with.

- **SHOES MAGIC**
These moves are in this category if they require the ballet shoes to work effectively aswell, similar to Stick Magic too.

- **BOOK MAGIC:**
These moves are in this category if they require the torn notebook to work effectively aswell, similar to Stick Magic too.


- **GLOVES MAGIC:**
These moves are in this category if they require the tough gloves to work effectively aswell, similar to Stick Magic too.

- "Increased Grip" -
Imbue the gloves with wandering magic, works at best when it has already grabbed someone, though by casting this move would make it harder to escape from the grab.

- **KNIFE MAGIC:**
These moves are in this category if they require any form of knives to work effectively aswell, similar to Stick Magic too.

- **STICK MAGIC:**
  These moves are in this category if they require magical stick to work effectively, either that or it cannot be simply formed without its stick's help.


**ADVANTAGE:**

- Really strong magic when staying to its trait, has multple soul stages and can even be powerful enough to wreck havoc.
- While hard to construct a move with it due to lack of multipurpose compatibility, It makes up for it by being effective at single task uses!
- Exceeds in Guard-Breaking and Single Target capabilities!
- Capable of paralyzing the opponents if they attempt to interact with its soul by grabbing or such, even a lot to know about it!

**DISADVANTAGE:**

- Magic Frisk will melt if they stay too determined for too long, suffering loss in DEF first, then ATK and then SPD, before completely melting. They CAN become an amalgamate. Although it can be delayed by using stranded magic to maintain the magical parts, but melting on the inside CAN occur in that case instead.
- Doesn't rely on reducing the opponent's options too much for what DT Class Wandering Magic can do.
- Ultimately, its out of luck if it wants to use this off the bat. Its soul stages are mostly achieved through how well it dodges or blocks in combat. Beware of essence overwhelm too!
- This magic has serious consequences. Multple to list here.

**PROCESS:**

- Stay true to your trait.

**ETC:**

- This is wandering magic, made by 'Friendly' here, so credits to em if anything.





###EQUIPMENTS:
**Half Magic Structure Helmet**

- This one is what Magic Frisk made for themselves from using wandering magic. Covering only its human part to keep it protected to make sure only its magical parts gets hit for damage.

**Special Flower**

- Its chara friend put a flower on them, turns out this flower is actually useful due to it being able to store massive amounts of magic. Since it can store a entire ult and have it be ready at any time to deploy. Also glows with Magic Frisk's magic too.

**Winter Scarf**

- Given by one of its friends, of course.

###DESCRIPTION:
Although used to be a normal frisk earlier, it got fatally wounded by explosive case happening on the surface, however..

It was brought back to life despite the fatal condition by a much friendlier monster willing to give their magic to the frisk's blown part of the soul. This process being described as 'Revival Magic'. This also made most of the frisk's body mostly magic too.

...Those two would be friends, exchanging info to each other, but unfortunately after one last leaving session, the next meeting, the said friendly monster never showed up because of the surface getting to it. But was enough to give it a reason to try and get to the underground.

Now, this frisk is nothing to laugh at with how it is. There has been theories that due to advance in magic development for this frisk, there might be a case where it might actually be able to absorb monsters, due to its magic exposure capability to have its soul take some of the attack's magic and use it to improve itself.

Even if it starts off weak, too. Although its actual title is unknown, most people gave it the title of 'Magic', relates to 'MagicTale' or just 'Magic Frisk'.

Later on with its journey somehow corssing into another world, would they encounter a certain type of chara, they didn't want the world to be interfered with by this frisk, so they wanted it to go with 'ERASE' option, which it did.
Later on would those two go on to become more of a friend, however this friendship has yet to reach being really close. Being given a stick even that it can make use of.

They're extremely multipurposal too, willing to help people even if it doesn't wanna interfere with other worlds, although it has no problems doing so in a 'realm' of which most people has yet to find.

Unfortunately, their long journey had some sort of mental impact on them that starts everytime they visit a multiversal world... And their mental state has to be kept in check to lower the chance of a breakdown.
