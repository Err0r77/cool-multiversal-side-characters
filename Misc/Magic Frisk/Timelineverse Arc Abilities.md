> [!NOTE]
> This is Timelineverse Arc kind of Magic Frisk, the original one DOES NOT have the following capabilities or such that are in this section!

## CELESTIAL POWER ABILITIES
STARTING STAGE:
> "They are capable of creating small cracks in the ground to release stardust, and can survive breathing a significant amount of it" -A friend that made Celestial Power Concept here.

### Dot Magic
Dot Projectiles that are purple are now capable of exploding into stardust.

### Shining Buffer
Target object flickers purple briefly before gaining a purple outline after returning to normal.
Increases overall potency including destructibility by large or even massive amounts due to
how when a buffed dot magic projectile gets fired, a entire place would explode.

### Shining Debuffer
The literal opposite of Shining Buffer. Except the outline would be darker purple.

### Grey Protection Spell [Now: Purple Protection Spell]
As the name change suggests, purple coating for the target soul.
Literally functions like Dusttale Green Shield mechanics here, except it doesn't literally regenerate at lightspeed or even rapidly there.
In another words, nullify damage, but will drain celestial power based on how much damage's taken.
Think of a shield bar!

### Status Protective Spell
Becomes dark grey, now any status effects thrown at it, especially blue magic, gets redirected to the attacker.

### Magic Barrier
Now able to move with it and especially send people into the air if the barrier is to be hit by them or especially touched.
Quote from a friend here:
> " the piercing attack's structure can also not longer be focused only on the piercing
> it has to be durable enough to not be absolutely crumbled on the sides
> basically you need a piercing based SP that isn't fragile as heck "

### Magic Retrieval
Literally becomes "Celestial Power Retrieval", can also be used to absorb celestial power around them throughout the world they're in.

### Body Enhancement
Magic Frisk can make a part of their body glow purple, making it several hundred times stronger as a result till the said purple glow effect ends.
Might aswell be able to send a whole continent to hell due to the fact that their physical strength can be increased by that much.

### Vortex Shot
Same as the standard one, aside from obvious upgrades such as explosive power of it, capable of affecting beams now.
That's all there is to it.

### Reverse-Vortex Barrier
It's literally just the same thing but decreased drain in magic.

### Piercing Accelerator
Now it leaves behind a trail that can be detonated into a large slash line.. As if
getting hit and wounded once wasn't enough already.

### Bouncing Piercer
It's literally a stronger version.

### Auto Light Defense
Upon activation, causes a flashbang AND is now capable of affecting semi-high or semi-heavy projectiles to detonate,
making heavy projectiles and above the only ones unable to be affected by being detonated.

### Burst Pulse / Pulse
Same as the above, stronger version. Although Burst Pulse - 5 would level the whole tectonic plate most likely.

### Shining Burst
Explodes in 'layers', the deeper the target is towards the center of said layer, the more devastating the damage is.

### Cannon Dance
FOR EVERY SINGLE IMPACT OF ITS PROJECTILE, CREATE A SMALL ENERGY PILLAR!

### Shining Healer
Delivers a defense buff as a package now!

### Complete Healing Wave
Now delivers attack AND defense buff in one package with the healing!

### Shining Strike
"get stardust poisoned", on hit.

### Magic Vent
Makes the area surrounding Magic Frisk more unstable!

### Rapid Hit Rotation
Mash two moves together and you got a setup attack that can deal BIG poisoning to people that gets too close to it-

### Magic Mine
B i g  k a b o o m !

### Magic AoE Mine
Greatly increases gravity in its area before blowing up to make it harder to avoid, upon activation!

### Magic Flare
5 Knockback pulses before exploding!

### Stick-Assisted Forcefield
The forcefield gains the benefit of uniquely shaping itself, allowing for a spike stab!

### Stick-Assisted Accelerator
The projectile's HECKING FULL OF HEAT OF A GOSHDARN NEUTRON STAR!

### [SR!] CATEGORY 10 MAGIC HURRICANE
Magic Frisk makes use of their vortex shots in enhanced form before then blasting a overload beam or ray,
thus creating a extremely deadly form of magic hurricane, destroying absolutely everything in its radius.

## TRUE CELESTIAL FORM AND CELESTIAL FORM'S POTENTIAL CONCEPT
> [!NOTE]
> This is the current concept as of now, but never was seen in action, so it may or may not be official to the timelineverse info.

In this state, Magic Frisk becomes by far the hardest to actually fight head on without resorting to trying to outlast it after healing it.
This form's weakness being of course, being outlasted, but you'd have to AVOID hitting it [otherwise you'd have to deal with stranded magic too-] and DO NOT let its wandering magic go up either.

POTENTIAL WAYS OF BEATING IT: it's either outlast it [wandering magic would die off, as long as NO MORE people gets pummeled by it-]
or if people have hit it too much, then heal it so stranded magic dies off, THEN resort to outlasting it after that-

### TC Magic Dash -
Upon activation, charges up for a bit before suddenly ending up close to the foe, in next few seconds, if the foe gets far away or more, the dash would become dangerous, otherwise it's just a slam attack.
If the foe is far away then the magic dash literally becomes powerful enough to absolutely slam the foe to punish for teleporting away upon the celestial power part's activation.

### TC Heavy Outer Pulse -
Alternative to Overload Beam, happens on second pattern, fourth and so on.
This attack's practically unavoidable due to TC Magic Frisk always following the person during startup, so it's HIGHLY advised to prepare to be slammed by time limit if this move is next.
Like overload beam, resets the pattern to a easier one temporarily upon use, and prevents disadvantage of dying from energy limit. 
*If this move is successful, the area it's used in becomes a battlefield for the rest of the battle because the opponent WON'T be able to go anywhere else, till it happens again, due to insane amounts of celestial power left behind from this oversized detonation surrounding the said area.*

### TC Dot Magic -
If this isn't worse than DMF and Original Magic Frisk to deal with, well it is now.
This move becomes classified as 'Dodge Killer' due to each projectile causing firework amounts of explosions in short time,
There is also a alternative projectile to this that goes at enormous speeds, practically becoming a mini shooting star in the process,
but is barely used as its second and fourth pattern aren't seen as much when this happens.
*Essentially the first move in the pattern.*
*Damage effectiveness drops a heck ton down to chip damage if blocked against, though.*

### Shining Star -
This move is RECOMMENDED to be stopped at all costs, as letting this move go on for 10 seconds straight will lead to the foe's annihilation!
This move is both shining buffer and shining debuffer, upon successful activation, the targeted foe gets supernova'd with force of celestial power enough
for celestial power to start killing them, not only that but also making Magic Frisk supercharged in the process, which may force them to immediately use Overload Beam or Heavy Outer Pulse after this move.
Cannot be cancelled by projectiles, a grab or strong hitting melee move's suggested to be used against it.

### TC Shining Regeneration -
This move doesn't count in the pattern whatsoever and is a passive, all damage dealt to it is regenerated by EX form of 'Shining Healer'.
Consumes Celestial Power over time the longer this is in action, which in turn means using up stranded magic or wandering magic more.
The main reason TC Magic Frisk cannot be fought against, head on.

### TC Throwing Javelin -
The throwing spear move. Using shields against this is not going to work, especially a barrier since it gets stuck on halfway through before blowing up, but saves the target from being inflicted by deadly effects or even pierced in that process.
Leaves a trail of celestial power everywhere it goes to till it explodes, in which it scatters the surrounding celestial power everywhere, especially the trail, the closer it is, the more affected the celestial powers remains will be.

### Blazing Celestial Spear -
Beware of SP's casted over time by this! This weapon of Magic Frisk if present in celestial power state before TC, the said spear becomes even deadlier!
Allows for 'Blaze of the Spear itself' usage [Vertical Slash SP] or 'Spear Sweep' [Horizontal Slash SP], the horizontal one however is MUCH larger while as getting hit by the vertical one is just immediate kill to any usual beings, if being split in half by stranded magic special attack one wasn't enough in damage.
