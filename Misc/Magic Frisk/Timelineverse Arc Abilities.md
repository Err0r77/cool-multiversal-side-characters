> [!NOTE]
> This is Timelineverse Arc kind of Magic Frisk, the original one DOES NOT have the following capabilities or such that are in this section!

## CELESTIAL POWER ABILITIES
STARTING STAGE:
> "They are capable of creating small cracks in the ground to release stardust, and can survive breathing a significant amount of it" -A friend that made Celestial Power Concept here.

### Dot Magic
Dot Projectiles that are purple are now capable of exploding into stardust.

### Shining Buffer
Target object flickers purple briefly before gaining a purple outline after returning to normal.
Increases overall potency including destructibility by large or even massive amounts due to
how when a buffed dot magic projectile gets fired, a entire place would explode.

### Shining Debuffer
The literal opposite of Shining Buffer. Except the outline would be darker purple.

### Grey Protection Spell [Now: Purple Protection Spell]
As the name change suggests, purple coating for the target soul.
Literally functions like Dusttale Green Shield mechanics here, except it doesn't literally regenerate at lightspeed or even rapidly there.
In another words, nullify damage, but will drain celestial power based on how much damage's taken.
Think of a shield bar!

### Status Protective Spell
Becomes dark grey, now any status effects thrown at it, especially blue magic, gets redirected to the attacker.

### Magic Barrier
Now able to move with it and especially send people into the air if the barrier is to be hit by them or especially touched.
Quote from a friend here:
> " the piercing attack's structure can also not longer be focused only on the piercing
> it has to be durable enough to not be absolutely crumbled on the sides
> basically you need a piercing based SP that isn't fragile as heck "

### Magic Retrieval
Literally becomes "Celestial Power Retrieval", can also be used to absorb celestial power around them throughout the world they're in.

### Body Enhancement
Magic Frisk can make a part of their body glow purple, making it several hundred times stronger as a result till the said purple glow effect ends.
Might aswell be able to send a whole continent to hell due to the fact that their physical strength can be increased by that much.
