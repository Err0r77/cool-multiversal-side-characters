DESCRIPTION:
InverseNil Frisk is one of What-If Frisk's, this one being if asriel really did go that far to concentrate beam or such to reduce this Frisk to nothing as much as possible.
However, due to how their HP is, it went to -1 and below, but never 0. Till it ended and the Frisk ended up losing their memory in the process.

There were side effects that came along with it too, for now, it's unknown on where else their story will go in currently.
