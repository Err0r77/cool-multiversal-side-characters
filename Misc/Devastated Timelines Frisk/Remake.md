LIKES:

DISLIKES:
None.
PERSONALITY:
Devastated Timelines Frisk doesn't have much of a personality, but has displayed being intelligent several times throughout its time recently.

It seems that it goes intelligent if it means that it'll win battles easier.

Besides that, it seems to still attack anything on sight, but doesn't pick battles that it cannot win at all. It does seem to keep going constantly however, always pushing its stamina limits and being restless to all hell here, never suffering from the consequences of it. And most likely never will with such mindset.

ACTIVITY'S WHEN NOTHING TO DO:
If it has nothing it could go after, it usually goes on rampage, either going into a world and wrecking havoc there by causing mass deaths and such or goes on constant search.
MECHANICS:
Stupidly / Overwhelmingly Determined
Also could be known as 'Determination Overwhelm':
Devastated Timelines Frisk's Determination is at stupid levels or if you actually treat that as a good concept, overwhelmingly determined beyond natural levels.
While it can be affected by code changes, those have set amount of time till its amounts of determination decides to repell it.
The more major the change is, the less the duration.
And the more it's repeated, the faster it'll expire.
So if people tries deleting em, its determination is going to outright repell the incoming change disregarding that it's a code change.
It can also form a save star manifested from its determination and throw it into air to have it start the process if it were to lose one of its 4 buttons too, where after a minute or so, it would suddenly form into said lost object.
This also includes the case of if it were to lose its real knife or locket, too.
Any attempts to use Determination Extractor on this would lead to the machine being overloaded before exploding. And manually setting the rate to avoid overload would just mean the machine gets destroyed by its attacks aswell.
Not that it would be able to stop this one anyways.
Determination can be rerouted to other things too if strong people were to end up disabling its position saving and loading aswell.
And the world that its in, every single person's SAVE and LOAD's functions are also completely disabled from being able to work here unless it is to LOAD back to their world.

Constantly Overworked
Due to it never stopping, its stamina is much higher than normal due to its machine-like mind being extremely used to being tired or exhaustion.

Two Branches
In situations when up against strong or powerful people, there tends to be a faint spinning star next to it that the opponent can see, it cannot be tempered with any way since it's only a indication. (unless people want to make their life hell.)
It can freely switch between the branches aswell. However, the second branch seems to be completely different as if it's a different timeline branch.
On its second branch, it has yellow[-white?] outline and now seems to be full of determination feel, infact it could be comparable to a gem or crystal in how it is, even glass. All of which is influenced by determination, thus the yellow outline around it.
This also means the said second branch's body doesn't have any form of blood at all, too. And also means too that the damage it takes, would mean full HP heal wouldn't fully fix the cracks, only make it gone halfway through.
The second branch also seems more capable of abilities that includes itself in some form or another because of this.

AutoAttack / Constant Attacking
It can send a ranged slash automatically once in a short while.
Passive Mechanic.

QUOTES:
None.
COMBAT EFFECTIVENESS:
DIFFICULTY AGAINST IT: [Unforgiving] - Regardless of the opponent that it fights, it would be a difficult fight unless it's the ones considered 'broken' or 'overpowered'.

Devastated Timelines Frisk has frightening strategies, techniques and moves at their disposal, especially standing out with the most unique moveset a Frisk could have too.

Unfair kills tends to fail a lot against this due to its determination mass to come back from death, just like any other Frisk's.

Code change attempts against this may vary on the severity, a outright deletion however isn't going to work at all. Attempts to disable a ability of it can also be repelled. Even if it's not a code change by any form too. This means trying to affect its save file by modification will be useless.

People with good or extremely good memory would have slightly easier time with this probably, but don't take this for granted in case it starts to throw out many projectiles in place.

God-like people can also fall to this aswell, for something that has that low of a stats, hence why the mention above that it shouldn't be taken as what it can actually do.


ABILITIES:
Devastated Timelines Frisk can utilize their abilities really well when it comes to combat or fighting, having a lot of combat experience.
This moveset is a force to be reckoned with, especially formidable due to how versatile it is in combat strategies.
Unique Magic
Devastated Timelines Frisk tends to absolutely push the capability of determination manifestation to next level here. And this kind of magic is no exception from this.

"[FIGHT]" -
Literally what the name says, Frisk presses the button, but the occurrence however is that a slash can appear from any realistically possible directions around the target. Be it from behind them or such.

"(SAVE) Star" -
It is capable of forming yellow stars and throwing them. It shouldn't be taken as small projectiles especially with explosive capability of those.
Those projectiles can explode on impact, but also able to SAVE and LOAD at any point of time aswell, except for when destroyed.
This means those projectiles can SAVE at the closest point to target when missing and LOAD before immediately exploding on the target.

"(Manifestation) Star" -
It can also form golden-colored stars that can be downgraded in shapes to be manifested, or be thrown as projectiles aswell to cover the part that it hits, which can stack.
Devastated Timelines Frisk can cause the parts covered by manifestation star to explode.
It can be better than this if Devastated Timelines Frisk actually took time to manifest it into a better shape though such as a axe, though would have to be hardened aswell.
Any attempts to absorb this will lead to guaranteed crit kind of explosion. Basically exploding the person, but worse.

"Spinning Energetic Star" -
Heavy Projectile form of attacks. It can form a spinning energetic star and either choose to swipe around itself with it like a sawblade or throw it as a projectile here.
Can be seen as Guardbreak move due to how it is.

"Large Spinning Energetic Star" -
Like the previous move, but bigger version of it. Second branch allows the Frisk to manifest into the said star instead for a short while while throwing out a bunch of star projectiles out before throwing it.
It can be influenced with more Determination from this Frisk aswell if it means to have more effectiveness for them there.

"EFFECT RESET" -
Also known as the fun instant-blue-soul-magic-screwing "EFFECT RESETED.", it can also be used as a way to clear debuffs even if it'll clear the status buff effects on itself aswell.
Basically 'RESET' on steroids.

"POSITION SAVE & LOAD" -
It can save its position 1, 2 and 3. And load any of those positions at any time provided to instantly appear there. Beware of this move's use cases though due to its involvement, especially in a special attack.
It has to save the said position again after LOADing it, however.
This said move can be disabled if the said opponent is strong enough, but if it's facing more than one strong people, then it cannot be disabled due to its determination becoming more active, or rather, making it flare up with more activity.

"DT Influence Offense" -
The yellow particles around its slash represents this, the more DT Influence rerouted to offense, the more damage it can deal than it normally would.
Basically reverse version of asriel hyperbeam damage negation.
The balance of DT Influence Offense and DT Influence Defense is usually half by half, balanced setting in another words.

"DT Influence Defense" -
The yellow outline around its soul represents this, the more DT Influence rerouted to defense, the more damage it can negate and survive.
Basically asriel hyperbeam damage negation.
The balance of DT Influence Offense and DT Influence Defense is usually half by half, balanced setting in another words.

"Following Slash" -
A SP reusable by Devastated Timelines Frisk, upon activation, causes a slash to appear above the target that follows where they go, it can only be dodged mechanically or basically like how sans dodges in undertale genocide route.
Or as a friend of mine describes it: 'force a "miss" by mechanic or its a guarantee hit'.
Otherwise, better get used to being damaged.

"Bright Star Rampage" -
Reusable SP.
A SP where Devastated Timelines Frisk forms a concentrated or dense energetic yellow star and have it flash extremely bright yellow color to blind everyone's vision that looked at it. Then the cutscene move will start if atleast one is caught in it where it dashes to each and have the save star's one of 4 sharp points extend to impale each with large damage, gets more upgraded the more people are caught in this where it rapidly accelerates to a entire army's each people being impaled, then save star suddenly becoming massive and just sawblading them all at once.

"Mass STATE SAVE & LOAD" -
Reusable SP.
Theoretically possible normally too, although the one seen here is a special attack form. It first gets ready, saving the state and then performing a attack. Then quickly loading and so on, spamming the hell out of it.
Allows for throwing out a bunch of star projectiles in rapid succession or causing a bunch of [FIGHT] attacks aswell.

"SP: TOTAL SAVE AND LOAD" -
This one allows it to save the whole battle's position and load it later on. Does not affect stats or cooldowns by any means, rather just saving everyone's positions in that fight.
Which it can then LOAD to do it again if needed.

"Fatal Attack Zone" -
Makes use of all 3 positions stored in a zone, long startup allows it to be easily gotten out of danger, but if people are unfortunate enough to risk their life trying to kill this Frisk and fail, the people caught in this or too close to it even, gets exploded with 5k true damage or hell, over 5k true damage if you're really that unlucky.
How the said attack goes is simple, since it'll load and save each positions to launch one hell of a attack everywhere within that zone. Star Projectiles and especially [FIGHT] attacks.

"Branch Escape" -
Automatically used when its main branch's HP hits 0, it suddenly switches to the other branch and jumps back instantly aswell. [or for style points, backflips if it happens by chance.] Basically 'Get out of Jail Free' type card in another words due to it disregarding stun. The faint star disappearing along with it, unless it were to manually switch, which in that case it won't jump back then.

"Determination Lock" -
Disables a ability or move, but is only usable when its position save or load is disabled. It's not a permanent disabling either since it only lasts as long as the fight goes.

ADVANTAGE:

Monsterous level of strategies possible with this, it's even hard to tell what it can pull off with.

Manifestation Stars can be formed into a piercing type projectile, or rather single-pointed projectile for when dealing with tough shields.

POSITION SAVE and LOAD has no cooldowns, allowing it to pull off extreme or impressive feats with this.

It has a move for if it needs to attack a target from extreme distances, especially since this moveset can be versatile in general.

Has a True Damage capable move, allowing it to ignore DEF completely if need to.

Moves combined with another allows for 'devastating' combo that immediately wrecks hell on the opponent.

Due to being Human Magic Type, it can automatically break through monster magic if the said monster magic doesn't possess enough strength to stand a chance.

EVEN with a disabled ability, it can adapt by redirecting its determination to something else instead, ensuring that the opponent cannot have easier time that easily.

DISADVANTAGE:

Simple-minded people are going to suffer trying to use this moveset. There's not much other disadvantages significant enough besides that.
ETC:

This kind of moveset cannot be learnt by anyone else besides them, unfortunately for any characters trying to learn to do abilities like them.


DESCRIPTION:
The one we all fear and know up to this day, Devastated Timelines Frisk.
Their backstory was in pre-remake one, but for the recent one, after being out of glitch corruption, its abilities truly shined there and allowed it to have much better performance if not much scarier.

It is also starting to slowly beat Alt. Sans now, it is only a matter of time till then, till the finale begins. It's even a surprise that Alt. Sans is able to keep up with this since almost every other sans'es got outplayed, outmatched or outpredicted because of its abilities, making it a actually threatening hazard in the multiverse.

It also has recently beaten Dusttale Overdriven Sans aswell, further proving that power-based foes no longer can easily win against it either. With its formidable amounts of moves and alongside that, the most unique aswell. Especially with its dodge performance too being something to fear for when it had done a genocide route endlessly and its mind now having become machine-like in the past.

Only one can hope that there'll be a stop to this someday, because people are sure as hell won't be able to easily stop this one.
