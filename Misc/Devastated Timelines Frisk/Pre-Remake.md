Role: 8th fallen.
STATS:
139 / 139 HP

>1099 ATK
103 DEF
LV 30

SPD: Extreme [300%-500% ish?]

WEAPON: Real Knife
ARMOR: The Locket

LIKES:
None.
DISLIKES:
None.
PERSONALITY:
There's not much to say besides it having a machine-like mind dead set on killing anyone as soon as it finds one to kill.

It does seem to ally with people that does help it if it does witness them do it multple times enough though.

ACTIVITY'S WHEN NOTHING TO DO:
It just goes on rampage.
MECHANICS:
GlitchError / NULL
This Frisk is capable of glitch teleporting or even glitching several times to reset its own cooldowns to attack spam and such. It having the ability to create stationary white slash that fires off several slashes or a explosive white slash capable of bringing down gods doesn't make it any better aswell alongside it sending 3 ranged slashes in quick succession, especially the SWING capability.
It can also throw out grey slashes that glitch teleports after missing aswell.
If its HP runs out, it undergoes phase 2 where it suddenly glitches and sends down massive white slash down to cause destructive massive explosion at its position to make anyone trying to kill it right now regret their choice, replacing its HP with Glitch HP aswell before going full on hellfire on its opponents due to the complete spam, especially able to do slash rift to launch white waves forward as projectiles too.
If said Glitch HP gets crippled enough down to 1, it glitches heavily before suddenly escaping in that case then.
Glitch teleport cannot be stopped unless it's up against extreme teleportation disruption, which in that case that's the only viable way to deal with this.
This could mean it's extremely hard to disable any of its abilities here, too.

AutoAttack / Constant Attacking
This Frisk sends a ranged slash automatically once in a short while.
Passive Mechanic.

QUOTES:
None.
COMBAT EFFECTIVENESS:
DIFFICULTY AGAINST IT: [Difficult] > [Unforgiving] - Extreme agression in attacking and being extremely scary or formidable to fight due to its capability in overall.

There's not much say in this. Goodluck to anyone fighting this here.

Expect glitch kind supports to come in to support it aswell during its rampage.


ABILITIES:
Devastated Timelines Frisk, Pre-Remake is filled to the brim with moves that are absolutely made to wreck havoc everywhere.
While easy to dodge on their own, a lot of those can spell doom, especially from other directions.
Unique Magic
No words in this.

"[FIGHT]" - Send out up to 3 ranged slashes. Middle point or not, it really doesn't matter if this one always hits all 3 reticles in the middle there.
"Grey Slash" - Glitch Teleporting Ranged Slash. Those can glitch teleport after missing or even at any point in time especially. Still dangerous to be hit by.
"White Slash" - Can either be stationary one that sends out more ranged slashes or a explosive white slash. The explosive white slash however is extremely deadly to be hit by.
"Dusted Slash" - Strong Ranged Slash. A white more explosion kind of this one does exist too where it's actually massive, however the normal one inflicts illusion type effect to the person targeted where it's seen as massive, with trail of dust. Causing flinch to the foes attacked by this that can't handle a sudden sight, especially when it travels on a quick speed.
White explosive massive slash however causes massive destruction and especially terrific damage to those hit.
In Glitch HP Phase, it seems to be possible for it to throw out a massive white slash that's stationary that fires out Dusted Slashes out forward.
"Slash Rift" - Cuts open a white glitched slash rift, sending out white waves forward as projectiles. Can be used defensively.
"Glitch Teleport" - Basically does what the move here says.
"Glitch Refresh" - It glitches in order to reset a cooldown of its own, or several times to perform a move several times over.
"NULL + GlitchError Unleash" - Usable in Glitch HP Phase. Its knife glows white, using 'NULL_Main' Energy. Then slamming it on the ground. the ground flickering white for a bit before then turning black, before a sudden eruption of bunch of glitch error spikes erupts in its surroundings, then it swings its knife up to cause the spikes to glow white alongside the ground next, before the same amount of spikes erupts all at once again but white.
There's also a aftermath hazard to this if done on a planet ground, where the entire area would collapse by a short distance downward soon after.
"NULL Corruption Projectiles" - Throws out white slashes alongside making its white waves now leave behind NULL Corruption trail!
ADVANTAGE:

Its abilities are inseperable from it, making its glitch kind type abilities unable to be disabled!

Devastated Timelines Frisk has a massive amounts of combo potential with its attacks, allowing for deadly yet extremely powerful combo.

With what Devastated Timelines Frisk has, this moveset is very much capable of taking on gods or even hostile beings stronger than it.

DISADVANTAGE:

There isn't much strategy to this moveset, leaving it suspectible to cases where it can be out of options or such, although this is negated by its strategy anyways.

It makes heavy use of glitch kind's help, limiting its potential that could have been more.

Ranged Slash spam.

ETC:

Most of the moveset here makes too much use of spamming attacks and such, so a note from hero here, this is one of reasons why i decided to rework it.



DESCRIPTION:
Devastated Timelines Frisk, based on a alternate timeline case of if Sans in the said timeline were to fail instead of succeeding, this kind of abomination is produced from the continued route and mess that it's in, that its mind eventually got double-edged to being machine-like.

Due to the Sans now losing hope due to having tried all ways possible against it, Devastated Timelines Frisk eventually ended up destroying their own timeline due to repeated timelines and genocides, eventually now out to wreck havoc on other worlds aswell.

Being a extremely formidable force to be reckoned with, the only ones in this series actually well known for rivaling it is 'Alt. Sans', whose's able to keep it at bay for a long enough while, sometimes having to use support to stop the threat temporarily and sometimes not due to succeeding on their own, however it is capable of loading back obviously enough, thus that alone wouldn't cut it.

It is only a matter of time till this frisk starts managing to be able to wipe the floor against everybody that we know of, till the present times, where a coordinated group defense had a goal of ridding the glitch kind off of it that had corrupted it alongside using it as a superweapon asset. Their operation was a successful and eventually Alt. Sans, with help of artifacts, managed to get rid of the glitch kind on it, which in turn.

...Made the threat a entirely different thing due to its different abilities.
