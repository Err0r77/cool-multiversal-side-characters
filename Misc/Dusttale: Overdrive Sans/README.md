LIKES:
None shown for now.
DISLIKES:
None shown for now.
PERSONALITY:
Dusttale Overdriven Sans tends to underestimate opponents who can become threatening to them quick, especially when it seems like he has much higher edge of advantage than they have power-wise, this being his downfall in his battle against Devastated Timelines Frisk, only being beaten due to him not going all out on them sooner.

Up to this day, he tends to fully activate the souls capabilities and stack them all together to be able to fight against foes that are just as capable as him.

Besides that, he is only driven by power to destroy worlds, a common goal, but still not very sane.

ACTIVITY'S WHEN NOTHING TO DO:
Constant rampage, however this isn't the only thing this san will do when there's nothing to do, or if there's nothing to destroy for that matter.

He does see what the souls he has can do, making sure he can utilize those correctly so he can destroy opponents easier.

MECHANICS:
Hundreds of Souls
Overdriven Sans, due to the amount of souls he has, the mechanics can only be compiled into here due to each abilities each soul has. This quickly makes his full power of all souls active extremely dangerous if not incredibly hellish to beat.
This introduces the mechanic of 'Souls Activity', as a way to track how much use he's making out of the souls he has, if he has souls activity at 100%, it means he's using all of the souls he has to full capability, making even his hyperbeam incredibly dangerous to be hit by.
This also allows him to have a phase 2 due to how the souls in him can be, however while he would have less HP, it's more threatening especially when he gets to his phase 3, which has much less HP, but at most dangerous aswell.
SOUL MECHANICS:
Soul Debuffs -
Every attack landed by overdriven sans will now inflict DOT and debuffs on top of that.
Energetic Spear -
Beware when he decides to form a energetic spear, since trying to melee him when he has it would mean you'd be hit with 5k% speed stab. Let alone 10k%.
Energetic Trident -
While not as threatening as the spear itself, he can initiate a auto attack with it, causing bombardment of stray high-level blast to come down on the targets, if focused, 75%. if not, 25%. But if he decides he had enough and should make it useful, 75% in that case.
Energetic Bounce -
He can bounce certain projectiles he throws and launch them at greater speeds back to the target if he can manage to.
Energetic Speed Mass -
Putting more magic into this, overdriven sans can send attacks from 3k% to 10k% speeds. This max speed however really wasn't done much, but could have been used if he wasn't this confident there to begin with.
Soul-Powered Immunity -
Some of the souls he has provides mechanic of being immune to debuffs, aswell as protecting himself from code changes.
QUOTES:
" oh, i'm having problems? let me double down on that. "

" gotta say, you WOULD have been a threat if you weren't mindless like this, all that determination would have been unleashed in rapid bursts and sent your enemies to hell. but it's sad that you really only have your own and not that. "

" i think this will get obvious fast. so i'll make it easier. "

COMBAT EFFECTIVENESS:
DIFFICULTY AGAINST IT: [Unforgiving] - I can only say nothing about this.

If you need a way to describe this, think of this sans as a sans in the role of godzilla.

Do beware of his creativity or imagination with attacks, besides that, expect people fighting it to have really difficult time even with a good setup there.



ABILITIES:
Overdriven Sans is horrifying on many levels when it comes to his abilities, often taken to absurd levels or such that he's essentially a hazard itself in another words.
Those abilities have no mercy either, especially when checked further.
Unique Magic
Not yet fully made there.

"Bones Capability" -
Not threatening until you realize he could fire those in storms, essentially a nightmare to dodge characters without proper ways to dodge this.

"Gaster Blasters Capability" -
Beware of those blasters, due to their durability and firepower, being hit by even one of those can be enough to make a person retreat from the battle due to damage, simply put you can basically get blasted past the shadow realm by those.

"Spears Capability" -
Also can be fired in storms. Not much to say here. Besides being deadly in piercing damage and such. Also can be fired at extreme velocities too.

"Fire Capability" -
Those are actually different in purpose. Being able to form a fireball and then explode it into large explosion or even massive.

"Blue Soul Magic" -
Can be used to immediately end a person in harsh way, but unable to be used if the said person has a counter to it, besides just shifting the battle's dodge styles here anyways.

ADVANTAGE:

This moveset can wipe out a whole group of enemies that are unaware or such, making it a hard one to fight against.

Its destructibility is nothing to laugh at, either.

DISADVANTAGE:

The problem with this moveset is that it's too ordinary or such, essentially just sans attacks taken to higher levels, although can be made up with its Soul Magic's capability to make enemies days a lot harder than if it only used unique magic here.

Besides that, there isn't much disadvantages here anyways.

ETC:

This moveset unfortunately doesn't seem to be able to be learnt by others here.
Soul Magic
Not yet fully made there.

"High-Level Blast Projectile" -
Those blast projectiles are deadly and tends to be hard to block, especially for those relying on it anyways, those can also curve if this sans chose to, too.

"Magic Detonation" -
Explodes the spot infront of it with magic detonation, simple as that.

"Energetic Spear - 10k% Melee" -
Using energetic spear, it can immediately suddenly dash up to a target and stab them at 10k% speed straight, better have a counter for that there before you get shredded by those. Can be done with two energetic spears too.

"Stream of Soul Magic" -
Fire off a stream of soul magic, deadly if anyone gets hit by it. Can be intensified into a beam, then into a ray.

"Glowing Bombs" -
Basically replica of mettaton's bomb attacks. Except those can explode in massive + and X combined shape explosions.

"Lines Replica" -
Form several lines throughout the battlefield where the blasts can go onto the said lines and fire off from there via energetic bounce. Fireballs can also go onto the said lines too.

"Cluster Energetic Fireball" -
Does what the name says, apparently, besides it being stronger than usual fireballs here.

"Line of Energetic Rays" -
Basically what the name says, can fire from either above or below.

"Mass Teleportation and Warp Disruption Field" -
Making use of Soul Magic, Overdriven Sans forms a field that can be troublesome, Even to itself.

"Energetic Bounce" -
Literally what the name says, it can bounce any of its certain projectiles to go at higher speed towards target position.

"Stray High-Level Blast Bombardment" -
Slam the energetic trident behind itself onto the nothingness or anywhere else, causing the stray high-level blast projectiles to start raining down here, used to be first 33% then 75% for chance of no stray projectile, but now 25% to 50%.

"Green Annihilation" -
Charge-up required move. Massive green warning sign above itself.
After short time here, its surroundings is then nuked with powered up kind of soul magic.
Follow-up:
Now with slight glowing due to soul magic maintained, forming the trident spinning it to pick which side to nuke, if the group refuses to spread out,
sans will just nuke them and their dodge space's privileges, inflicting that place with DOT aswell due to slamming the trident down on that said side for eruption.
Extended:
Overdriven Sans can choose to break the said trident to intensify the eruption into a beam for a short while to encourage dodging even more.

"Pulse Nuke" -
Charge-up required, it glows slightly before releasing massive pulses that reaches outward to supermassive, each dealing heavy damage to everyone not careful there. Then following it up with exploding the area completely after over 10 pulses.
Follow-up:
It then turns towards the shielded group's direction, quickly charging up by making use of powerup before immediately blasting that direction to punish absolutely everyone that doesn't consider team support movement in time.

"Massive Dome Field" -
The move of problems of all time. Requires chargeup, but can be a massive problem when done, trapping everybody within said field.
Follow-up:
If the opponents were to escape however, it can charge up before instant-filling the dome to make it a massive ball of devastation, and at almost-same-time ALMOST-INSTANTLY having sent it straight at the foe to explode it on them to punish for lack of realization, not that it was easy anyways to get said idea.

"Atomic Orb" -
A follow up after massive dome field. Hitting those things causes devastation to everything around it. Quick chargeup required. Luckily if the trident hits it by throw, it'll be sent flying knocked in a direction to bounce around and not explode instantly.

ADVANTAGE:

Not completed yet, keep this in mind.

Nothing much to say about this due to how many moves this sans can have, There isn't a advantage or disadvantage here, besides lack of system-like abilities or anything like what devastated timelines frisk has.

Horrific if not near-infinite amount of soul magic here at its disposal, allowing it to keep up with high-intensity fights or especially keep up with PMF without losing right away. Although unfortunately would still lose to it due to PMF dodging attacks frequently and such.

DISADVANTAGE:

Not completed yet, keep this in mind.

The only disadvantages here is that it doesn't have much counters against dodge characters or such, but can make up for it with horrifying combos if need to anyways.

PROCESS:

This depends on how well Overdriven Sans knows about their souls they have obtained on the destructive rampage process.
ETC:

This can become incredibly dangerous real fast if this sans again, wasn't so confident to begin with.



DESCRIPTION:
Also known as much proper take on DustDust concept made by Hero / Err0r77, Overdriven Sans is basically murder sans gone too far into their process that they forgot the reason they were doing all this for and rather was power-driven,

Now destroying everything in its path as it advances, not as mindless as devastated timelines frisk even, since it can think well too. Although it had lost against it due to Devastated Timelines Frisk's machine-like mind being more intelligent now.

However, unlike them, this one is much more of a threat due to it having destroyed way more worlds than them and even taken hundreds of human souls with it, having now evolved into this abomination of a monster, even able to be considered a sans in the role of godzilla.

It had suffered through multple kill squad attack attempts from the multiverse aswell, of which it had managed to beat all of them, despite the part of its skull being cracked but now healed from that case.

So far, the only group to have survived the encounter and managed to drive it away was the realm group itself and their strategies to survive better than kill squads from multiverse did, due to experience with S-UM's.

Although dear lord, for anyone that were to encounter this and can't contact the realm group, i advise not fighting this at all and just outright escaping the threat. Otherwise, goodluck fighting against it due to the fight in general with it being ultimately extremely difficult to win, if not hard even to begin with.

This is what you can call a abomination, as Dusttale: FW Sans seems to always despise.
