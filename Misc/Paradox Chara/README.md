LIKES:
It is interested on reading books, especially information too.

Finally finding the personality that they prefer, which, goodluck to them.

Having good friends and doing few fun things.

More than that may depend based on what personality it may choose to go with, perhaps..?

DISLIKES:
Noticing that Paradox Frisk is in trouble will cause Paradox Chara to take action immediately, especially comfort them.

It feels really uncomfortable using its glitch attacks.

More than that may depend based on what personality it may choose to go with, perhaps..?

PERSONALITY:
Its chosen personality will NOT be mentioned due to its constant change to try and see which one would fit it the best, only the placeholder one will be mentioned here:

The placeholder personality being that it doesn't hesitate to say things that could be dark or such, such as death and all. Can be a bit playful too as seen when it told a random error sans to try and guess the second thing keeping it alive.

May be more than just that, though?

ACTIVITY'S WHEN NOTHING TO DO:
Not made yet. Although i'm pretty sure it wasn't going to be much anyways.

Although if it is having trouble finding Paradox Frisk, it would be on constant search for them in that case.

MECHANICS:
Soul condition
If anyone were to try and affect it soul, it would automatically fail due to the ability failing to find the soul. due to again, basically and literally already dying.
The gap in their code is also much worse than just large. It's basically like blank and barely any code found in there. basic read-only info only.
Their soul's more or less fragmented with each fragment being a really small gap for each. also glitching a lot too.
Alternatively in simplicity it codes are gone, but well, atleast not readable enough to be considered 'gone' anyways.
Side effects of complete paradox makes it hard for the frisk to forget memories by magic sources also.
Additional note: The frisk's current soul cannot be identified also due to the current condition of it.
Although it used to be determination so maybe it's staying the same way?
Additionally,
It gets constant pain from time to time. Which lasts for a short while or so and usually happens on random parts of it. Although this is mainly due to not being used to being in places outside endless black void.

Partial Fourth Wall Interference
It can 'read dialogues' or especially see ghosts or phantoms. Those 'meant-to-be-invisible' things.

Frozen Death State
Counted as dying, yet cannot be healed nor 'revived'.
If a heal attempt on it was to be made anyways, it would just throw a error or in another words, error from it the same way as how damage errored, but no jumpscare, anyways-
(effort to try and do anything with it dying state would fail due to how complete paradox is, too.)

Stability
Upon being hit, it will really hurt em but not damage em. with a loud save star loading sound being heard that keeps em in existence. [possibly LOAD attempts? either way, goodluck not being jumpscared by this-]
Whenever this happens, it takes stability damage instead of HP damage, and it can only be dealt up to 5% at maximum per damage.
Although the frisk can feel enough pain to be knocked out if that's too hard for you. Although to kill them would take a really long time of constant attacking till it finally gets a bit more corrupted and dies from it death process resuming.
Or in this case, getting self-deleted from corruption.
Usually it takes 0.1% or 0.5% from getting hit by normal attacks.
Self-regenerates if left unchanged for a while.
Example of this mechanic's function: Error 404's first god ray may freeze, but the next one won't kill it. Only deal 5% stability damage to it at maximum. It literally survived complete paradox once even if it can't do it again.
Its stability percent also cannot go over 200%, otherwise that resumes the death cycle and it'll immediately die.

'Connection' Stability
Think of client and server ping! It can prove to either have not much effect on it or just flop and have negative effect such as damage increase to its stability. If it's too unstable however, it'll have to head back due to it constantly suffering stability loss.
It has to be in a place like anti-void or anything with boundaries are unable to lead to stability loss or it may aswell be in the wrong place.
It can also go for other places too, hoping that it can have high stability rate there.

Hibernation Capability
It can enter hibernation state where it's just having a light sleep till someone makes a minor noise close to it or any minor interactions with it to wake it up. but can go on for even forever if it goes uninteracted that is. Hence it could set a certain time duration for it till the ability automatically wakes it up out of that state.

QUOTES:
Not added yet.
COMBAT EFFECTIVENESS:
DIFFICULTY AGAINST IT: [Difficult] > [Unforgiving] - This Chara is capable of fighting, especially well too. While difficult, some people that does keep on trying to defeat it are bound to be a problem for it.

Doesn't do well with tolerating pain, so it can't really tolerate it well, if ever that is due to it not getting used to the constant pain and likely unable to anyways.

Note that it's extremely tanky as hell. So while beating it in overall is effortless.. Trying to kill it would be a difficulty tier 3 task.

Unlike Paradox Frisk, this one does not lack in attack capabilities due to its glitch attack ability.

It being capable of teleporting or warping can also be a problem to some people aswell.

At best case scenario people can get with this is if it's suffering from connection stability mechanic.



ABILITIES:
Paradox Chara is more capable unlike Paradox Frisk, as of now, there's around two abilities to expect from them.
There are nothing else other than that.
Unique Magic
Nothing much else aside from teleportation capability.

"IMMEDIATE TELEPORTATION." - Instantly disappear and reappear. However has a startup though.
ADVANTAGE:

Nothing.
DISADVANTAGE:

Nothing.
PROCESS:

Nothing.
Glitch Abilities
If Paradox Chara holds out their hand and begins to have a lot of glitches around it, drop your focus on it immediately due to surprise elements out of nowhere. More to be added on this later.

"Stretching Textures" - Glitch appearing near the opponent and stretching out towards them before instantly disappearing and dealing damage upon hit.

"Glitch Defense" - Glitch Barrier infront of itself, can only block against one direction of where the attack's coming from.

ADVANTAGE:

The ability being capable of surprise attack element allows Paradox Chara to force foes to drop their focus on them temporarily.

Possibly other advantages to include too.

DISADVANTAGE:

May still lack in moves that it can do with this, using it also makes Paradox Chara feel really uncomfortable too.

Not advised to be used against anyone that completely counters any form of glitch types here due to the ineffectiveness it can have.

PROCESS:

Unobtainable.



DESCRIPTION:
Also known as paradox chara. This one was brought back thanks to it narrator part still existing. With that, this 'character' was created for sole purpose of having that narrator part compatible with it.

The mysterious man experimented with tools and tried to recreate the same complete paradox survival, recreating isolated place over and over and causing complete paradox to it for each of it created. Till it can recreate the effects similar to paradox frisk of which it can use to expand on it.

...They succeeded, they got what he wanted, but the only con is that it has some kind of stability, a form of connection. This can either prove beneficial, having not much effect on it. Or it can flop and have negative effect on it. Causing damage increase to it stability.

If it's too unstable, it'll have to head back due to it constantly suffering stability loss. It has to be in a place like anti-void or anything with boundaries are unable to lead to stability loss or it may aswell be in the wrong place.

It can also go for other places too, hoping that it stability rate can be high there.

Capable of travel but unfortunately due to paradox frisk's own effects, it can't locate them without help unless it comes across them somehow or they return to it.
It also has been equipped with few tools that it can use to defend itself thanks to the mysterious man.

Alas. We now have paradox chara. Fun to be with sometimes if anything. But deadly on it own.
