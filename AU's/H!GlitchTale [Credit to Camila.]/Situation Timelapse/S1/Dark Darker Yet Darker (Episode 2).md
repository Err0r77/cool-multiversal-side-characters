## SIDE NOTE: This is only including the canon one, however in reality of multiverse, someone along the lines of 'Forer' and 'Alt. HM Sans' [those two made by a different friend of mine here-] has helped the H!GT Cast.

DIFFERENCE ONLY STARTS AFTER MEGALOMANIAC:
**DARK DARKER YET DARKER EPISODE**
```
GASTER seems to have said something in the darkness.
"FASCINATING..."
"THIS TIMELINE SEEMS TO BE... STRANGE."
"MAYBE... JUST MAYBE..."
```

---------
**WATERFALL:**
``
Frisk surprise greets Sans happily to wake him up, but not out of surprise. Sans responding with:
"heya kid. my legally-required break recently started so, mind if we go to grillbys? i wanna talk to you about something."
Frisk happily gives a thumbs up to Sans.
``
``"alright, come with me, i know a shortcut to it."``

``
To Frisk's surprise, they suddenly got taken by FUN Value of the timeline. Where Sans ended up in Grillby's wanting to talk about not wanting them to RESET like this any further, but noticed that they were gone and looked for them in the place before teleportation.
``

``
Frisk meanwhile was walking forward till it noticed a mysterious grey door, not remembering seeing a door like that being there, out of curiosity, it walked up to it. Opened the door and noticed a mysterous figure as it walked in.
``

--------
**ENCOUNTER:**
``
The figure was Gaster, with static occurring. Frisk noticed the door closing and immediately try to grab on the handle of it, but failed because it forcefully closed itself beyond Frisk's physical abilities.
``

``
Frisk, acknowledging that there's no way back then, decided to be ready in case due to the figure's potential intentions.
Gaster then said the following:
" UNFORTUNATELY, I HAVE LONG SINCE, PREPARED FOR THIS. "
" YOUR SOUL OF DETERMINATION.. I FIGURED, IT CAN PERHAPS... "
" IF I TAKE IT, IT'LL BRING ME BACK. "
" SO, I'M AFRAID THAT IF YOU CONSIDERED ON RESETING EARLIER ANYWAY.. THAT WON'T BE A OPTION ANYMORE. "
" AND I ONLY HAVE TO JUST KILL YOU ONCE, RIGHT? "
``

``
...And to their expectations. Gaster of course attacked after the last line of dialogue.
Several void shifting spikes erupted around Frisk suddenly before slamming on them down, with another row erupting and then the third.
Frisk was quick to start momentum, running through safe gap of the surround attack each.
``

``
Before immediately being surrounded suddenly with violent eruptions of more void spikes right as it was in mid-dodging process that rapidly closed in, but was quickly saved from harsh efforts by Sans responding by appearing inside the surround with sudden blasters firing downward at the spikes from above to clear it out.
