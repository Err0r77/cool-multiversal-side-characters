`INFORMATION YET TO BE FINISHED.`

There are many souls and traits that currently exists, so we piled up all that we could find into one massive information board. Including enhancers.

## HOPE
This is potentially a second enhancer like HATE to the souls but similar decimating side effects, it is white enhancer.
It takes over the user slowly aswell, easier depending on said person's positivity and such. This can be cancelled out by HATE, although can be reduced by negative feeling.

However, while good to have HOPE unlike HATE, having too much of it will cause the person to be taken over and forget who they are, the only solution to it being to almost kill the said person for all HOPE to be eliminated on it.

When that happens, the person will be back to before they forgot, so it is always best to not lose yourself from this.

Its goal is the opposite of HATE, be the saviour to people no matter what, this goal also ignores the person's needs, so their hosts tends to die as much as HATE's hosts are.

It is possible to overpower it the same way with will as it can be done with HATE, but would mean the said person depending on their will, will have their limitations before being taken over.

HOPE magic is achieved by anyone either able to handle high amounts of it or are taken over in general.

## Determination
The strongest trait up to date.

## Perseverance
This trait is close if not similar to Determination, although can only use close-ranged capabilities as weapons influenced by it that those holds always stays on.
