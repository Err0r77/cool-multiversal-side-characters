*`This can practically work with any souls as long as it's up to six and is compatible, the mechanics would then add up in cooperation and form a team in overall with HM Frisk being the Leader!`*
*HM Frisk WILL not be empowered by this, however.*
*The souls are unable to throw healings when having to move along unless the ability says something about it.*

*The abilities here are incomplete and would only be further worked on after the human soul characters in underground part or chapter are done. [Part/Chapter 1 basically.]*

###HM PATIENCE:
**Waiting Time**
Negative Status Effects to any allies near the soul and especially on HM Frisk, expires faster.
Positive Status Effects lasts longer and Neutral Status Effects are nullified.
**Preparation**
Slowly gains more knives over time, but rarely would one of it be green of which would be thrown to HM Frisk.
###HM BRAVERY:
**Arrogance**
The orange soul gains orange glow, rendering it invincible to damage for a short while or less, but also immobile. Duration extends if its protection continues to work. But can also immediately end.
**Respect**
The orange soul throws out thumbs up heal everytime HM Frisk's performance is successful on a action and is significant.
###HM INTEGRITY:
**The Saving Grace**
The blue soul will dash in to save HM Frisk from danger at times.
Medium Cooldown.
**Everlasting Stability**
Able to both heal HM Frisk and dodge attacks.
###HM PERSERVANCE:
**Trapping Line**
The purple soul can stop attacks completely dead in their tracks by deploying purple lines around the field, can also trick foes into it and force them to have limited movement.
**Much-Needed Supplier**
The purple soul starts healing when HM Frisk is in trouble, but has limited amount of heals, however are more beneficial than the rest.
###HM KINDNESS:
**Cheer Up**
The green soul has more impact on HM Frisk's DT Levels when cheering unlike every other people's cheering.
**Supportive Kindness**
Kindness will always support HM Frisk no matter the circumstances, throwing a healing item to them at available times that instantly heals on contact.
Possesses the ability to transfer damage its protected person gets to itself.
###HM JUSTICE:
**The Fair Helping and Vengeance**
The yellow soul will interfere depending on how much in the wrong the opponent is, if HM Frisk needs help and how unfair the fight is for them. Or if the opponent has literally made too much crimes to atone for.
Can basically shoot down attacks with exception of beams or explosions. [Unless it blows up the source first.]
If the opponent wants to deal with constant bullets 24/7, they can either be too much in the wrong or be extremely unfair to HM Frisk in general.
Will not leave any other foes out besides the target.
Will also heal HM Frisk to balance out the situation.
**Watchful Soul**
Yellow soul will immediately shoot at any hiding foes spotted first priority.

#`SOULS DESPERATION`
**[Weakest / Least performance, but strongest one of HM Frisk and their six souls condition!]**
*`Works regardless of HM Frisk's DT Levels, but is most tiring for HM Frisk as due to micro-managing.`*
`HM FRISK RECEIVES NO DEFENSE BENEFITS, FULLY VULNERABLE BUT MAKES UP FOR IT WITH ALL SOULS IN A RING AROUND HM FRISK.`
[The music to listen to during this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv9WRM-3td8)
**The soul's DESPERATION**
If HM Frisk is about to face a fatal damage, the souls all together goes in to take the damage for them, the damage being split across all of them with at maximum being half of the soul's HP.
**Last Stretch**
If this state is at massive disadvantage or is close to going down, the souls would circle around HM Frisk much faster that the ring effect is more visible. Tiring HM Frisk out further, but boosting their ATK to abnormal levels.

#`SOULS COOPERATION`
**[The middle ground of performance for HM Frisk and their six souls condition!]**
*`Essentially the most often seen state, requires HM Frisk to be up to DT Level 4.`*
*`HM Frisk's DEF gains a passive.`*
[The music to listen to during this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdHOu9K1Wyk) (THIS IS SHARED WITH HM ASRIEL'S MUSIC TO LISTEN TO!)
**The soul's BARRIER**
If HM Frisk is about to face a fatal damage, the souls diverts their help to them, causing HM Frisk's HP to only go down to 1 instead. This won't work if it's already at 1 though.

#`MASS SYNERGIZATION`
**[Peak performance of HM Frisk and their six souls condition! Last seen used against HM FloweyX after the souls heard Frisk's call.]**
*`Only works if ALL of the said souls are at their peak level and are willing to help HM Frisk.`*
*`HM Frisk's DT Levels becomes a enhancer in this.`*
[The music to listen to during this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvLCax9c2Hg)
**The soul's SYNERGY**
The souls no longer are stopped from healing by dodging.
Each hit from HM Frisk now downs all defenses that nullifies their attack, a automatic DEF drop to 0 in another words.
