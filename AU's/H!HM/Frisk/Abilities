###ABILITIES:
- Two magics that this frisk has are known to have a strong offense class attack.
- They drain HM Frisk by 25% or more on use. Making those attacks useless in cases of long battles. 

**Plant Magic**
This frisk has learnt this thanks to tomb, with this, it's capable of following:

- "Flower Stem Growth" - Focus on the flower infront, after reaching good enough concentration, it'll carefully and slowly raise it hand next, keeping the focus. Not sure on what else happens there-

- "Small Gust Of Wind" - This is easier with wings, focus on the flower. and carefully, slowly. hold it hand out, performing gust of wind type move.

- "Flower / Plant Manipulation" - Focus on the flower it's holding. Building up concentration on it till it pops to go up to it face.
raising the hand that's holding the flower up may be required too. 

- [^ Sub-upgrade ^] - "Manipulate into attack" - After good enough focus on a flower object that it's not holding, it then uses a hand gesture to make something. such as raising a flower object up infront of itself by raising it hand gesture up.

it has raisen a vine wall infront of itself doing this process for first time if anything i guess- 

This is how it can form spiked type plants. Larger varients are possible but uses up more magic, possibly even stamina.

- "Healing Plant Attack" - Clear it own thoughts and be in more relaxed state. having to close it own eyes. [to enter healing mode i'm guessing? 'close it own eyes' part might not be required.] Then, watching the flowers [likely supposed to be 'flower' instead of 'flowers'.] bloom. Causing it to emit green healing wisp.

Cannot be done in combat by any circumstances till the fight's over or it can be calm enough to do so.

Medium-Long cooldown.

- "Flowers float ability" - Combining the wind move, it really carefully held out it hand and raised it up to direct the wind concentration to float. Floating flowers!
[Can be used together with another ability to summon spiked type plant projectiles and shoot then forward.]

- "Vinefield" - Long startup and easily disrupted. But if the target lets it grow, it'll be able to have recovery varient of vinefield under the ground it's on. And allow HM Frisk to attack from there too. Upgrades plant type strong offense class attack as long as the vinefield's not destroyed.

Prepare for this move to be targeted on first priority immediately due to how strong it can make plant type strong offense class attack be.

No one's wanting to be swarmed and overwhelmed completely by vines from all directions straight to death from being impaled and such. 

- **" Awareness Summon " \**
Considered illegal in the one of multiverse council, use at your own risk.

- "Flytrap" - Same startup phase process, but focus on the ground. Then throw surrounding awareness [basically be more aware about it surroundings if anything.] into the mix.

It'll then result in small sprout on that location.. Then it'll form into flytrap after that. 

- "Echo flower Growth" - same move process, but in waterfall.

**\---------------------------------/**

- "Pellet Gesture" - Focus on the flower, concentrating on it. However the hand has to be raisen for this to work. It can then direct then if possible.
[The pellets attack are speedy too if anything. Which can be a problem for the enemy.] 

- "PLANT - STRONG OFFENSE CLASS ATTACK 1" - Drains HM Frisk by 50% after the attack. Starts off with erupting spiked type plants 1 by 1. Then 2 by 2. Then 3 by 3 and then at the last part, complete barrage.

**ADVANTAGE:**

- If the enemy lets you prepare and such, you can end up with a REALLY powerful stance of plant magic. Let it grow and it'll be able to overwhelm the enemy with each plant death, 10 more coming to take it place.

- Supports healing magic unlike other magic's.

- Multipurpose!

**DISADVANTAGE:**

- disadvantage of plant magic: ground-based magic or basically needs flower environment. or grass if possible at higher stages. also, when using plant magic, speed has to be limited down to slower speed. and not the normal speed unlike fire magic. basically forced careful movement.]

**PROCESS:**

- 'Startup Phase' - Focus and build up concentration on the flowers basically. Or anything else necessary that's plant-related.

- 'Prepared Phase' - Enough concentration is now built. It's constructing a attack formation.

**ETC:**

- It's used to plant / vine spike attacks.

- [Status in that multiverse council: 'Offense Team' and 'Defense Team'.] 

**Fire Magic**
It also learnt this too, being able to perform fire magic if needed!

- "Fireball" - Focus on the source of anger. [which is someone that it knows and lost in a fight.] And then breath out. Making a pointing gesture aswell. This forms a fireball, can be increased in scale up to large. Overdo this and you will drain yourself out in exchange for terrific attack at massive size.

- "Burn to a crisp" - Touching the plant with good amount of concentration on source of anger burns it into a crisp.

- "Fingergun gesture" - Focus, then form a fingergun gesture. and aim. Fire on command after that. Flame bullet attack.

- The fireball circle can be formed by the frisk and is more used than plant magic in fast-pace situations. Being more used to this in combat situations.

- "FIRE - STRONG OFFENSE CLASS ATTACK 1" - Drains HM Frisk by 25% after the attack. Starts off with bursts of fireballs and after that, some circle of fireballs aswell. If determination is high enough, then some fireballs can be determined varients to blow up to scatter fireballs at it target or to explode them.
Can transition into large fireballs part aswell.
which can be second strong offense class attack,
and then the third one once smokescreen has been created.
Beware of the consequences for using all 3 of them though. Especially since all 3 of them being used in one counts as Special Attack too.

- "FIRE - STRONG OFFENSE CLASS ATTACK 2" - Drains HM Frisk by 25% after the attack. Large fireball part, either rains them down or fires them forward. Causes smokescreens more often than all other attacks that it's used to. Keep in mind that DT Magic can upgrade the move if HM Frisk's determination is high enough to sacrifice for this.

- "FIRE - STRONG OFFENSE CLASS ATTACK 3" - Drains HM Frisk by 25% after the attack. Circle of fireballs part. Forms them to either close them in on target or to explode them right away to blow them up. This happens several times and can end rather quickly. 

**ADVANTAGE:**

- Doesn't require as much careful movements as plant magic, may be easier to switch to fire magic too than plant magic's switch speed.

- This means HM Frisk can switch to fire magic faster than switching to plant magic.

- Tends to get REALLY destructive if HM Frisk were to snap. But ends fast too. 

**DISADVANTAGE:**

- Fire-type element means it can be intercepted by water type elements easily.
Be careful to not blow yourself up with fireball attacks. This magic can deal recoil damage to it user.

- Even though it hands can heat up when fire magic's selected or active. Using too much fire magic attacks can lead to overheating. This means it cannot spam fire magic attacks unlike plant magic attack.

- If the user were to snap, they'll suffer the consequences of despite making it fire magic attacks really strong and destructive, they may suffer recoil damage and especially their hands heating up way more up to above the safe levels aswell.

**PROCESS:**

- 'Startup Phase' - Focus and build up concentration on any source of anger it has.

- 'Prepared Phase' - Enough concentration is now built. It's constructing a attack formation.

**ETC:**

- No extra info's for now.

**Determination Magic**
This frisk's determination varient is a concentrated one, the more determination it has, the more of a beast it becomes! Keep being more determined and you'll be able to unleash hell quicker and quicker.
It learnt this from 'hollowtale frisk' with ambition magic that they have.

- **[DT Level Consumption]**
- "Minor Boost" - Focus on it own soul, then onto the weapon of it choice or projectile to enhance the stats by minor level, depending on DT Level. Becomes status buff at either of stage 5's. Minor consumption, depending on how much it chooses to enhance it by though is how much it'll boost and use up DT Levels. 
- **/ "Determination / DT Magic Manipulation" \** - Focus on it own soul to draw some of determination magic from. Similarly to how consumption part of stage usage works but less determination used and then concentrate on the object it wants to affect.
- "Slow down" - Slows down the said object. It effectiveness depends on the determination stage. At stage 5, it can slow down objects quickly. Stage 6 means it can bring objects to a full stop without struggle. Medium Consumption. Gets reduced down to low if at any of Level 5.
**\\-------------------------------------------------/**

- "Explosive Rods" - Focus on it own soul and then on the stick ammo, making them glow red and turn into red glowing explosive rods. If successful, it'll be able to explode on command. Depending on status effect the soul gets too, the effect carries over to the rods, making them deadlier in the process. High consumption. Up to around 0.75 DT Level. [easily becomes not much of a cost at either of Level 5's. especially Level 5B.]

**ADVANTAGE:**

- If used well, this magic is capable of beating a lot of people. A well-trained DT Magic user is capable of creative and unique attacks that can surprise the foe and sometimes even have complex varients of moves.

- In the case of concentrated one, it becomes more powerful the higher in DT Levels it user goes up to.

- At it full potential this may unlock full capability and the tools necessary to win a battle.

**DISADVANTAGE:**

- Overdoing the magic can lead to serious side effects, even to certain death or loss of the trait if the user even survives. Use with carefulness and caution to not go too far on things.

- This kind of magic is EASILY cancellable due to the requirement of not letting feelings get in the way of feeling determined.

- Concentrated DT varients ends up using determination as fuel most of the time for it moves in favor of them being more powerful.

- DT Absorption moves or even DT Extractor can easily disrupt this magic and especially being hard counter to it. Assuming that they're enough to completely stop it.

**ETC: **
In part 3 of HM Frisk.
