###NEW ABILITIES:

- By the time around 19th day or 20th, HM Frisk has gained new magic abilities from their teacher, those are the following:

**Plant Magic**

Thanks to Tomb and the sub-au friend, it has gained the following new abilities:
Disadvantage: No plant magic when at low stamina, not relaxed enough means it can go horribly wrong. Side effect of this one if used wrongly is paralysis.
*Defense Magic.*

- "Shined Sprout Growth" -
Take a flower, focus on it, imagine happy things and then close both palms together. Then the yellow light will be emitted from its hands, causing a sprout to be made.
Place it on any compatible ground and a small tree will be able to be made from it by letting it grow.

- "Flower Stem Growth Second Form" -
Same as flower stem growth move, but the rised hand must be kept up, rising up further too if possible and the focus being on the plant it made for which one to grow.
Improvements can be by focusing as usual on it next, normally. And the concentration to be at usual, making it sturdy and firm in the process.
If the wind isn't that strong, then that means it's doing well then.

- "Plant Blooming" -
Think of a good memory that makes it happy and the focused plant would bloom flowers as a result. Can target the flowers to make it turn into a fruit too.
If a person is to eat that fruit, they relive their own memories.
The fruit is basically a quick health snack.



**Fire Magic**

Fire Magic also received a addition too:
Advantage: When tired, it becomes stronger.
Disadvantage: Overuse is not advised due to being able to overheat, can cause burn scars.
*Offense Magic.*

- "Controlled Fire Lighting" -
Basically 'Burn to a crisp' move, but scaled down. Requires focus to be able to be done. Can be done through placing a finger on the target object too.

- "Fire Charge" -
Basic steps of the Fire Magic, then keep the same position and straighten the back a bit, then think of something that makes it uncomfortable and keep that thought. Then hold and put their hand into a fist.
Allowing the fire to then become a bit more bluish but still orange as a result.
*Can overload.*

**Star Magic**

*Not enough moves in this category to have advantages, disadvantages and such yet.*
The newer magic taught by Tomb. Those are the following:
Can be used when on guard at all times.
*May be treated as a defensive mechanism or passive.*
Disadvantage: Don't use it too frequently as it's defensive for a reason. Otherwise it may cause self-damage, which is 50/50, 50% is moderate damage and 50% is light damage. Both only just takes a bit of HP off though.

- "Faint Star" -
Be in a more calmish position, be relaxed and then think of any star, then look down [this part's optional most likely-] for the faint glow to be seen emitting from its hands like stars.
Can act as a save star in some cases and convenient for when running away.
