**As this frisk possesses over 20 weapons and armors, it would make sense to list them here.**
*non-finished section.*

###WEAPONS:

**Stick**

0 ATK
`[* Ever wondered why such weapons has 0 ATK?]`
`[Perhaps if it was a branch, it would be more useful.]`
`[* Multi-purpose weapon however.]`
*Literally nothing worth of mention besides 1 reticle bar.*
*Can be multi-purpose due to being able to be used to ACT through [ITEM].*

**Toy Knife**

3 ATK
`[* Plastic Weapon, while questionable with damage,]`
`[monsters are more vulnerable to physical harm after all.]`
*One reticle bar, a bit faster than normal however.*

**Tough Gloves**

5 ATK
`[* Keeps your hands warm and safe, helps with]`
`[hand-to-hand combat aswell.]`
*One reticle bar, but upon hitting it, mash must be done for higher damage.*
*Can be seen as attacking in fast succession, basically the weapon with fast attack speed.*
*Punch Card makes this stronger.*

**Ballet Shoes**

7 ATK
`[* If you're skilled with this, you can even,]`
`[have a chance at attacking while dodging.]`
*Unlike in UT, this weapon later on becomes useful for throwing attacks during enemy's turn. Retains original ballet shoes stuff besides that.*
*3 Reticle bars in this.*

**Torn Notebook**

2 ATK
`[* Strategic-Role Weapon, increases your INV by 6.]`
`[(Allows you to be invulnerable longer after a hit.)]`
*2 Reticle bars in this.*
*Can affect how fast KR drains HP.*

**Burnt Pan**

10 ATK
`[* Would be stronger if it wasn't this burnt,]`
`[but damage is still consistent.]`
`[* 'Naturally' boosts your item's healing.]`
*Same as original Burnt Pan.*
*Damage is rather consistent with this burnt pan and all healing items used with this equipped would heal 4 more HP aswell.*
*4 Reticle bars in this.*

**Empty Gun**

12 ATK
`[* This would be more dangerous if it was loaded,]`
`[you have to be precise with your melee aim still, though.]`
*Same ability as the original empty gun. High damage if precise reticle in the middle but the reticle also goes very fast too. 4 Reticle bars in this.*

**Worn Dagger**

15 ATK
`[* The final natural weapon in the underground, multi-role.]`
*Becomes 'Real Knife' with 99 ATK if to be found on genocide route, however.*
*While surprising for 'Real Knife' 's ATK, the reach still has to be considered when in real combat.*

**Enhanced Shield**

20 ATK
`[* A really sturdy block obstacle to block incoming attacks with.]`
`[* Breaking this shield is out of the question. In exchange for more knockback.]`
Parry Effectiveness: Low
Block Effectiveness: High-Massive
*Powerful durability. but in exchange for dealing knockback to its user. the more hits the combo lands on the shield. the more the knockback.*

**Curved Dagger**

25 ATK
`[* Hit with precision makes its ATK shown]`
`[look like underestimation.]`
Parry Effectiveness: Medium
Block Effectiveness: Low
*Special ability being to be capable of climbing better than humans would without it.*

**Quarter-Staff**

30 ATK
`[* Quite the quarter power for both of your needs.]`
Parry Effectiveness: High
Block Effectiveness: Low-Medium
*Has 2 modes, either to attack or either to defend. however it defensive mode is only effective against melee's. The ranged attack's damage can only be negated.
Basically can help with eliminating need for switching from weapon to weapon.*

**NEO Blaster**

35 ATK
`[* New blaster for mettaton.]`
`[Scrapped since you ended up being peaceful.]`
Parry Effectiveness: None
Block Effectiveness: Low
*The attack button has to be held during dodging, depending on how long that attack was, the attack damage after that would be boosted. it can go as far as to make up A WHOPPING 80% OF THE DARN DAMAGE WITH ONLY 20% BEING NORMAL DAMAGE.*

**Mages Staff**

45 ATK
`[* If only you were a trained mage.]`
`[* Seems more dangerous than QuarterStaff despite this.]`
Parry Effectiveness: Medium-High
Block Effectiveness: Medium

**Heart-Charged Saber**

50 ATK
`[* Reacts according to your soul's color. Still gets defeated by curved dagger.]`
`[* But what it beats curved dagger at is being versatile, thanks to Alphys.]`
Parry Effectiveness: Medium
Block Effectiveness: Medium
*The weapon has a unique ability that changes depending on soul color.*

**Metallic Gauntlet**

55 ATK
`[* Wielding this weapon, you'd wish you could hold another weapon.]`
Parry Effectiveness: None-Low
Block Effectiveness: Medium-High
*Increased DEF when equipped, however blocking attacks with it will not nullify damage and rather soft block damage inbound.*
*The only exception to this is if it's held by someone physically strong like Magic Frisk.*
*When using FIGHT with this, reticles can come from both sides instead and starts slow, but quickly speeds up rapidly.*

**Affected Axe**

60 ATK
`[* Second weapon too deadly for liking, but seems to flicker.]`
`[* Goodluck getting countered with this.]`
Parry Effectiveness: None [Due to flicker.]
Block Effectiveness: None [Due to flicker.]
*Due to it being a flickering type weapon, it means it can deal extremely scary damage even if it's easy to miss. Counters are most likely to fail against this kind of weapon here.*

**Energetic Tank Club**

65 ATK
`[* I gave this weapon a additional name of Club,]`
`[because once you hit it, it only explodes once.]`
`[* Don't hurt yourself with it.]`
Parry Effectiveness: None
Block Effectiveness: None
*Upon a successful hit on anything, explodes only once per battle, dealing damage to both side with the target taking heavier damage here.*

**Draining Scythe**

70 ATK
`[* Not as deadly as curved dagger, but each hit grants you a heal.]`
Parry Effectiveness: Medium
Block Effectiveness: Low-Medium
*Unique reticles system, instead of rectangle attack box, square attack box. And adds on vertical reticles to it too.*
*Heals the user of said weapon per hit.*

**Enhanced SledgeHammer**

75 ATK
`[* Terrible block and parry, a hit coming from this is a guaranteed stagger.]`
`[* I don't recommend spinning this. Unsafe mentally.]`
Parry Effectiveness: Low
Block Effectiveness: Low
*Every successful hit with this weapon guarantees a stagger.*

**Titanium Pipe**

80 ATK
`[* Drop this to make the most iconic sound, backfiring on you aswell.]`
Parry Effectiveness: Low
Block Effectiveness: Medium
*Upon being dropped and hit, inflicts stun to HM Frisk's surroundings at short range, if hit by burnt pan or frying pan. x10 stun and up to medium range.*
*Goes up to x20 stun and far range if hit by enhanced sledgehammer.*

**Heating Hammer**

85 ATK
`[* Superheating this weapon leads to the opposing weapon of your choice to be melted.]`
`[* While also making it mentally unsafe.]`
Parry Effectiveness: None-Low
Block Effectiveness: Low-Medium
*When superheated, become capable of melting the target's weapon upon hit.*

**Electricial Lasso**

90 ATK
`[* The only weapon you can rely on to down your targets dodge after hitting.]`
`[* Do not recharge unless against the most annoying of UM's]`
`[for extra damage.]`
Parry Effectiveness: None
Block Effectiveness: None
*Inflicts 'Electricified' to target on hit which increases electric damage taken for the said target.*

**Uncharged Drill**

95 ATK
`[* Runs on electricity and energy. Unsafe mentally.]`
`[* Better to not recharge it anyway.]`
Parry Effectiveness: Low
Block Effectiveness: Medium-High
*In theorized genocide route, it is safe to assume that this weapon's recharged, making it deal massive damages in overall deadlier than Real Knife.*
*However, Deadly Greatshield completely levels both of the weapons at attack damage total and especially other purposes anyway.*

**Sturdy Greatshield**

100 ATK
`[* This shield seems like you can use it to power through weaker enemies with ease!]`
`[* Resilent to lots of types with exception of those capable of piercing defense.]`
Parry Effectiveness: None
Block Effectiveness: Massive
*Extremely resilent meant that it won't break from damage, but due to it counting as superheavy, it disables swift movements.*

**Deadly Greatshield [THEORIZED GENOCIDE WEAPON]**

NO KNOWN ATK ESTIMATION
`[* Makes quick work of everything.]`
`[* Still resilent.]`
Parry Effectiveness: Low-Medium
Block Effectiveness: Massive
The weapon is basically Sturdy Greatshield but with sawblade attached to it.
*If anyone dead in the mind were to ever use [FIGHT] with this equipped,*
*the fight bar may show up, but there's one little twist.*
**THE ENTIRE ATTACK BAR IS MET WITH FLOODING RETICLES LINE!**
*which they can all be pressed, so it's literally just mash to kill the enemy to beyond overkill.*
*If in a nutshell, basically constant 999999's.*
*The attack in 3d can be represented as bunch of slashes coming from everywhere in rapid succession for a bit per each swing.*
*While it may be still superheavy, the way more stamina loss and such doesn't apply in this genocide route theory.*

###ARMORS:

**Bandage**
0 DEF
`[* ...How did you end up being this hurt,]`
`[anyway to be using this?]`
`[* Anyway, reapplying it helps stop bleeding.]`
*Retains what the original bandage does, allowing for near-always success of FLEEing, until you realize it only works against non-boss type UM's and such.*
*Upon unequipped, become consumable. Heals 10 HP upon re-applying.*
*Instantly erases 'Bleeding' status effect or stops a bleeding upon re-applying.*
**Faded Ribbon**
3 DEF
`[* Apparently with this, you tend to seem cuter.]`
`[...Don't expect that to stop UM's, though.]`
*Nothing much happens, unfortunately with this.*
**Manly Bandanna**
7 DEF
`[* Emphasis on the mispell.]`
`[Besides that, it has.. 'Symbol of strength' written on it.]`
*Dialogue changes when at Mid-Part 1 or Chapter 1, no further changes after that, the below here is after the said change has occurred. Due to 'Asterisk' finding out how Human Languages can be.*
`[* Turns out it doesn't matter if you say 'Bandana']`
`[or bandanna. Still has 'Symbol of Strength' written on it.]`
**Old Tutu**
10 DEF
`[* Don't get ahead of yourself.]`
`[Such protective armor like that, while works against magic..]`
`[* Have yet to prove against Physical.]`
**Cloudy Glasses**
5 DEF
`[* Glasses marred with wear, as you can describe it.]`
`[Increases INV by 9. (Be Invulnerable for longer after a hit.)]`
*Can affect how fast KR drains HP. Besides that, retains what cloudy glasses does originally.*
**Stained Apron**
11 DEF
`[* A armor item with natural healing.]`
`[Heals you 1 HP every turn.]`
*Pretty much original kind of Stained Apron.*
**Cowboy Hat**
12 DEF
`[* Decent armor both for defense and attack side.]`
`[Increases ATTACK by 5.]`
*Basically like the original cowboy hat armor item.*
**Heart Locket**
15 DEF
`[* It says "Best Friends Forever."]`
`[You should be able to know who values this a lot here.]`
`[* Beware that it can't help much with physical damage.]`
*Like the Heart Locket in original, becomes 'The Locket' with 99 DEF when found on genocide route.*
*The difference being is that physical damage breaks through this DEF.*
**Temmie Armor**
20 DEF
`[* Surprisingly a armor that works both against Magical]`
`[and against Physical kinds of attacks. You can rely on this.]`
`[* Increases ATK by 10 and INV slightly along with natural healing.]`
`[This means you also gain 1 HP every turn.]`
*Like the original one, increases ATK by 10, increases INV slightly and heals by 1 HP every turn. The difference however is that its DEF actually works against physical damage aswell, making it actually the first armor to be reliable when dealing with Physical and Magical kinds of Damages.*
*Not to mention its healing by 1 HP every turn is also ridiculous, until the realization that HM Frisk is dealing with strong and dangerous UM's anyways, so all that is going to be useful there.*
**Backshield Plating**
25 DEF
`[* Incredibly-useful starting armor,]`
`[gives 3-hit shield to help you live longer.]`
*As the dialogue implies, it gives 3-hit shield, which has no HP however. Only how many hits the said shield can take before going out.*
**Platforms Side Cannons**
45 DEF
`[* It spins for each shot just so]`
`[you can do it again.]`
*[Starts off with one when using FIGHT first time of the fight.]
[Then anymore continous FIGHT usages makes it two shots instead of one.]
[Mostly due to circle component in the side cannons spinning to fire the other cannon and so on.]
[Shot's ATK: 20]*
*[Hidden Property: Reduces speed due to the weight of this thing.]*
