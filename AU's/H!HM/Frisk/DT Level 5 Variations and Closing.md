**DT Level 5A**

- It becomes more hopeful, being able to refuse death if needed in exchange for less stamina. Cannot be done if it's too tired though.

- This gives it 'Hope' and 'Dream' abilities, functioning similar to asriel fight. 'Hope' reduces damage and heals a bit. 'Dream' does more in healing. 

- Can even form [SAVE] button easier than DT Level 5B.

- During this, it can also do the same as DT Level 5B's DT Magic - Slowdown but with bigger cost to do it. Though it can try and use the target's determination against then with determination manipulation ability if anything in order to be able to advance further towards Level 5B by fulfilling one of the requirements in the process. 

**DT Level 5B**

- DT Magic abilities gets boosted and so are it magics too such as fire and plant, giving them red-tint colors.
for example, if it holds it hand out to perform small gust of wind, it will apply status buff effect to it as soon as it fires, causing DT Magic to spark through the wind to inflict flinging to fireball attack or to launch the target straight away.

**STARTING:**

- It unique requirement is that it has to have enough determination to be past DT Level 5A, hero must be feeling determined enough to feel side effects. and requires high amounts of cheering.

- it'll then remind itself to stay determined, focusing on it soul and then.. Exploding in a determination explosion in the process.
turning into more of a undying state.

- it'll also gain determination armor-like thing [which is what negates most of the damage], it stats gets doubled. and it HP goes up to 150, if the target can easily beat it though, it'll jump up to 1500.

- Determination Manipulation in DT Level 5B also gets stronger to the point it can stop all attacks it targets temporarily. Cannot be abused though since that can quickly exhaust it determination magic energy. 

- it can ALSO happen if it tries absorbing determination energy attacks that are on extreme levels and it has low HP. or feeling determined enough. however it'll only get half of this state. [75 HP, 1.5 multplied stats, etc.]
but it'll become full state if hero starts to receive side effects from being too determined.

- it weapon also gets enhanced with DT Magic too. making it have red aura as a result.

**STATS:**

HP: 150 [1500 if against a opponent who can beat 150 HP varient easily.]

ATK: depends.
DEF: depends.

STAMINA: Lower than DT Level 5A, but enough to still unleash hell for a while before having to regenerate stamina.

STM REGEN: Unlike ALL ELSE of HM Frisk, this one's way higher when it's taking it time to regenerate stamina. where in other DT Levels it ain't as fast.

it armor isn't like GT Frisk's since it's always visible, heavy DT armor if anything-

SPD: Slightly lower.. But quickly accelerates into high speed when running.
In this state, it will mess up WAY LESS often. The pattern to beating it is everytime it finishes bombarding it target with attacks is when it starts to regenerate it stamina, take it as your chance to deal damage to it! 

**ADDITIONAL ABILITIES:**

**/ [SPECIAL ATTACKS] \**

- "Determined Fire Piercing I" -
Form a massive fireball and hold onto it before launching it down. Blows up the entire area on impact.

- "Determined Fire Piercing II" -
Same thing but apply status buff effect onto it to make it glow completely red. Destroys the entire area harder than the first one would.

- "Determined Fire Piercing III" -
Deadliest attack out of all others that Level 5B has to offer. When it reaches that point, the fireball will suddenly start glowing a bright red light. Large to massive light coming out of it, when shot, it'll tear and even blow through a lot of attacks as long as they don't overpower this kind of attack. Also nuking the whole place and blowing it up completely. Violently in a massive explosion. It also goes at really high speed too if it is to be fired at anything too. so basically and if anything. Spear of justice, apparently!

This attack has 3 uses. The tier uses it by the amount of tier that varient is. For example. 'I' uses only one use from the attack. 'II' is two uses. and 'III' is all of the attack's uses.

It only refills when HM Frisk goes DT Level 5B again after that. Or basically: it's refilled back to 3 for everytime HM Frisk goes to DT Level 5B.

It drops to 0 if HM Frisk leaves the Level 5B state too especially if anything. too.

**\ ------------------ / **

**/ [BUFFED ATTACKS] \**

- "Weapon Enhance" -
Basically, it weapon's enhanced, whatever it held at the intro of this DT Level will be enhanced to be able to do this.
It can slam it weapon down on the ground for determination explosion to happen there, although it can happen in any other DT Levels with some DT Level consumption as a cost for doing so, this one's stronger!

- "Minor Boost ALT." -
Making use of minor boost that's now upgraded into status effect varient. It can also hold out their offense-class melee weapon, aiming then as if it was like a gun at the target. and using some of it own determination to perform a perfect accuracy type of attack.

- "Minor Boost" -
Becomes status buff effect ability. Allowing it to actually boost it weapons or projectiles properly.
The status effect can also be turned into a attack if trained well enough to do so. Such as shield slam with the determination shockwave attack part added onto it to make it guard-break. or break enemies that are currently blocking into non-blocking position. basically punishing em for blocking. 

- "Determined Fireball" -
Same as normal one but it has bigger explosion and deals more damage, can be manually detonated too, Can be done in any other DT Levels with some DT Level consumption as a cost to it though. In this DT Level 5B though, it can unleash a ENTIRE horde of determined fireballs as a attack instead of few ones. 

- "Determined Plant" -
More damage, better capabilities, etc!

**\ --------------- /**

- "Faster casting and switching"
In this DT Level 5B state, it is able to switch to different magic way quicker! Startup phase is now faster!

**ADVANTAGE:**

- HM Frisk's full potential is now unlocked to them, allowing them to beat it enemies to COMPLETE HELL.

- Unlike what DT Level 5A can't do best at, is what this one can do best at, tanking blows and countering blows effectively.

- Most feelings for HM Frisk are negated aswell aside from being determined, allowing them to tank being mentally affected 3 times before it really starts getting to them. where the DT Level 5A can only do it as much as they have hope. And the rest can only handle 1 time before falling apart.

- This DT Level 5B state is in theory, faster than all other DT Levels when at maximum speed. Beware of stamina usage though.

- Gaining LV is impossible in this state since magic would be the one absorbing EXP instead, increasing it ATK a bit more. Allowing HM Frisk to kill without consequences.. ...But look at the disadvantage side.

**DISADVANTAGE:**

- Cannot refuse, but it can survive being at 0 HP for a short while before actually dying. [assuming that it adrenaline rush isn't used up yet.]
It takes longer to successfully form [SAVE] button than how fast DT Level 5A would form it.

- This state cannot last for too long, if it does, it'll start falling apart slowly with only damage taken starting to double few times per while.
If it goes enough for anyone to be able to presumably kill HM Frisk's current HP in one blow in the fight, HM Frisk will fall unconscious immediately. It'll take a long time till they can successfully recover.

- If they have killed anyone in DT Level 5B, before falling unconscious, it head will hurt by how much this state has absorbed the LV for it kills. Worse than just safely leaving DT Level 5B which still hurts them by how many has died to this state.

- By the end of this state, HM Frisk will end up being extremely tired, needing rest from all this. Hence the side effects above.

###DESCRIPTION:

Destiny of their world, with golden heart and has a goal to complete. Since the events of broken time and space, it has improved over time till it can beat UM-1, then UM-2 and so on till late-major UM's. Their appearance may be a bit different or so, but since then it has adapted. And unknowningly to them, they've picked the path that will keep their positivity and their mental state aswell, unlike the rest in the process and completed it too.

They're well-known for their positivity, pats and especially that they know what's going on. They listen to people's stories and such.

They faced troubles that they themselves could not complete alone though. As such, 'Asterisk' offered to help them on the journey with the ability to energy swipe to deal good damage to the UM's.

They don't like to see what genocide would be like and they are against suffering aswell. Although not innocent from it mistakes in the past from resetting in hopes of taking care of it curiosity by FUN events, it broke it world in the process and regrets it.

Quite defensive and even thanks to tomb's training, able to perform magic's. Thanks to the ambition frisk or murderous frisk's training, it DT magic is learnt next. And it seems that there's no end to those things.

For all that can be said is that they'll continue to spare even at the face of death, trying their best to help people's lives to be more bearable and easier to live.
