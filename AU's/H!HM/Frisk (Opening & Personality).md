-
WEAPON: 'Enhanced Shield'
ARMOR: Temmie Armor?
###LIKES:
- Peace, Positivity / Kindness, Friends, Being cared about, Looking at Good Nature and Helping people. Feeling safe too.

- It also likes having a good friendly fight too. Along with patting people. Although it WILL apologize if they find it annoying and will keep things in mind.

- It also likes plushies too and will pat em!
- It won't forget about the dogs too, making sure to pat em too.

- it's also interested on learning things too, especially about unique magics and stuff!

###DISLIKES:
- RESET being mentioned anywhere near em, it gives them bad memories and may be repressable kinda problem. They just want to forget it.
So it won't like to think about it.

- Not being able to make a difference no matter how hard it tries due to it choice not mattering.

- Friend's concerning death, that saddens them if anything.

- It help doing more bad than good, it doesn't like it when it help has worsened them, it just wants to help.

- Getting a nightmare from feeling unsafe due to UM's being able to show up at anytime to attack them while sleeping, it has to feel enough positivity or safe enough to prevent it.

- it also doesn't like ruining sleep too, so it can be a polite one.

- It also doesn't like the deadliness side of things. For example it found curved dagger really dangerous due to it potential being deadly and only prefers to use it as a last resort due to it precise strike's nature.

- It can't resist having to help when it sees someone feeling downed, since it can get concerned about em. Especially with it goal of trying to make other's lives more bearable and easier too.

- It has hard times bringing itself to hurt it friends, being another disadvantage. Especially since it doesn't like hurting them and will ask if they're alright too.
It also asks if they'll be alright after the process too, even then it doesn't give it their all as it's against killing. except for UM's.

- It doesn't like having to LOAD or RESPAWN. Those ruins it own world more and more. Completely against RESET for multple good reasons.

- It doesn't like genocide route, at all. Canonically it has not seen what genocide route is about but it'll definitely not like violence of it. And it won't like to find out about it either. can be amazed at undyne's undying form. or how sans can destroy killers despite being the easiest though. or be concerned at terrifying power of real knife weapon.

- Do not let it see close friends die tho.

###PERSONALITY:
- Extremely positive and determined on it current goal, yet knows what they're doing and is interested more on FUN Value events and would even prefer it over genocide.

- But the amount of selflessness it has due to putting other's safety above it own is concerning. It'll do a LOT to protect it friends.
Sometimes even as far as to fall asleep while protecting, although not forgetting to let it friends know.

- If it senses a good ending path? It'll go down that path when it finds the option to it!

- But atleast it does go by 'whatever makes ya happy!' part, kind too and talks in lowercase.

- It only actually speaks when feeling distressed enough. [or in any other extreme cases.] or when it feels comfortable enough to talk with it good friends here such as it own world's friendly humans and monsters.

- It fear tolerating isn't as god-like as HM Sans or CT Hero. or most CT AU hero's in general. So it does get concerned a bit or fears horror sans slightly. So it'll be on guard if it spots em. Definitely doesn't like their hand drill trick.

- It has liking for nice creams, top favorite. It likes pie too though. And water aswell.

- Even compliments people too! Even if people's stuff ain't that good, it lets em know that they will get there sooner or later! After all there is a potential for improvement. 

- There's a special case where it'll go on a patting spree if it feels encouraged and positive enough to do so, it's also on a pat quest too.
it'll not leave others out if anything.

- It'll try and not let it guard down, so it ain't any better than 'Asterisk', who alerts the frisk and keeps watch on surroundings. Trying it best, but the critical problem of this frisk is that sometimes it constant sparing can lead to a certain potential death. 'Asterisk' starts throwing advises when that happens, trying to save the frisk more specifically.

- It's also seen tired from time to time from it search for fragments or just not being able to sleep properly most of the time.

- Although being only a child or teenager is also a problem, not being a adult makes it harder for them to handle things sometimes. This includes fighting, so don't expect them to always win.

- It WILL hug people if the case is bad enough to award it or if it feels like it. It also can happen if they ask too. due to 'whatever makes em happy' quote.

- It doesn't mind being called something else too if it makes em happy, for example of this quote for it:
" * It responded, introducing itself as Frisk, although most that it knows calls it HM Frisk, which it doesnt mind. "

- It weapon's favorite being a shield. 

- It doesn't mind dancing since it has done those stuff likely before, too! Although this may be one of possible reasons for its decent evasion capability.

###ACTIVITY'S WHEN NOTHING TO DO:
- It has liking for snowboarding so if it finds something that it can find fun to snowboard on, it'll do it.

- It learnt to make sculptures too mid-era or late-era. Being on a quest to make all of it friend's sculptures too. Although it is thanks to that ghost frisk with apron.

###MECHANICS:
- **Graze Damage**
Anything that manages to 'graze' the soul deals 2 damage only to the frisk, more if it's facing higher ATK opponent.

- **Parry**
Basically hard to pull off, depending on parry effectiveness of it weapon, but if successful, the attack parried's immediately launched to another direction. More stamina costly too.
`Cannot parry beam attacks or anything too strong to parry.`

- **Soul Evasion**
Newly learnt technique at late of the game, flickers into a soul and allows it to perform battle box evasion maneuvers, but more costly in stamina to use than dodging normally.

- **Emotion Effects**
Being saddened lowers it ATK and DEF, being mad increases it ATK and lowers DEF. Being positive, well.. It doesn't do much. Being afraid has same impact as being sad, but depends on the type.

- **DT Level**
Complicated mechanic, requires cheering to start boosting the frisk beyond it normal levels. It's also unlocked up to certain levels if the fight allows it.
It DT Level's progress can be made by being more and more determined, requires higher and higher pressure. And most importantly, enough people cheering to advance up a DT Level.
Benefits for going up by one DT Level awards more capability of fighting tirelessly. But it does not restore stamina, especially when it's in negatives.
Special cases are DT Level 5A and DT Level 5B, 5A is achieved by it having a abrupt end or it seeing end of the road that it could not get out of, additionally the previous requirements still applies and must remain determined aswell. It allows them to refuse death, but for each refusal is less stamina. Making it more tired, being too tired disables it ability to refuse.
5B is the most rare case. It can only be unlocked by overwhelming amount of cheering, determination and pressure. It also has to be losing aswell.
It'll have it own category later on. 

- **Bullet Hell Evasion.**
Loses the ability to position itself, but it'll dodge like heck on surrounding concentration. Gained from dodging enough UM attacks.

###MORE ON DISLIKING CATEGORY:
- They don't like being in a world full of gods, mainly due to the risk's there. They'd rather want to be safe than to die immediately there. unless it feels comfortable enough and knows that it is friendly environment for it to be in.

- There ARE extreme cases part of disliking category too, so watch what topic you go onto, though don't worry, it'll try and let you know if it doesn't like the topic if anything! 
but if kept going.. well, it'll have to say some things about it. or if saddened enough, it just goes:
" i feared that curiosity might get to me so.. i preferred to find fun value events around my world in hopes of keeping it at bay.. i.. just want to make sure i'm helping.. not making you suffer through.. resets. please don't pressure me on that topic ever again.. " 
if you keep going,
it can even lead to it crying.
" i dont wanna be blamed just because i had to keep my curiosity at bay.. finding fun value events more interesting.. i know i likely made a mistake but.. i wanna forget about it.. i didnt want to hurt everybody.. i dont.. wanna hurt.. more than i help people.. " 

- It WILL flee if it faces more than 1 major UM, it isn't supposed to deal with those alone till it has enough power to do it.

- It DOES have some thoughts, but always tries to not be on dangerous thinking line.
after all, it does know what it's doing.

- It also can panic if it screws up with the whole 'nononono-' kinda thing. Although for some reason that's ultimately really rare to see.

- It doesn't like using other's energys too much either, so don't expect it to use 'Asterisk' 's energy to warp more than 3 times in one world most likely.

- It doesn't like going on different routes either unless it's better than pacifist / the current route it's on.

- Definitely won't like it if their world falls apart and collapses completely.

- Fears curiosity too, not wanting it to get to it here and cause bad case scenario in the process.

- It won't throw itself into danger till it feels necessary too, so it does keep a safe distance away if anything-

- repeating this again:
basically, it won't like hearing about the reset topic being brought up.
and they definitely don't like doing more bad than good here too. 

###QUOTES:
- Having already joined on HM Gaster's quest as they're this frisk's best bet to finding out how to fix up their world too in chapter 1 part.
" * It told them that it would conflict with it goal of fixing it own world though. " -HM Frisk at time of being made and being kind to people here.

- " * It told them that actually, it would do better when alive and still helping people, like them for example!" 

- " i am destiny! "

###COMBAT EFFECTIVENESS:
**DIFFICULTY AGAINST IT: [Hard] > [Unforgiving] - Excellent in defensive side and offensive side. DT Levels can do a LOT there.**

- The frisk definitely knows how to hit their opponent, how to counter and definitely how to feint too. But can screw up sometimes if they lose concentration for a bit, 'Asterisk' continues to advise em to not get distracted. But aside from that they're good enough on dodging side.

- They don't wanna move too fast as that may deal concentration loss to em, gotta look where they're going after all. So they prefer careful dodging maneuvers.

- They're able to negate mental effect coming from bad memories and thought of their friend's potential friend that could have taken at the kid's age a day to recover, where as for this frisk, the effect's negated. the debuff would be concentration loss, but it's negated to concentration loss for a bit, meaning whenever it gets breathing time in the fight, it'll be hit by it.

- They did not just destroy few major UM's for nothing by themselves after all.
However, if they remain in DT Level 1 in the fight for too long, stamina consequences may happen.

- But it doesn't mean that Adrenaline Rush cannot trigger, when in extreme danger, the adrenaline rush will begin and it may cripple it or such, but in exchange the frisk is able to make last few moves devastating, being able to grab a foe and throw em. or slam them on the ground and barrage em with fireballs.

- They also may have hard times keeping itself away from surrounding hazards such as water when in a fight due to the shield's knockback.

- As due to how Strong Offense Class Attacks that it may perform drains HM Frisk by 25-100%, if HM Frisk ends up using none of them, prepare for a long battle.
