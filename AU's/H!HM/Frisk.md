##The Destiny with Golden Heart.
##Role: 8th fallen, vital to keep alive till start of chapter 2.

###STATS:
15 / 15 HP
LV 1

20 ATK [Enhanced Shield gives 20 ATK here.]
20 DEF [Tem Armor?]

SPD: Depends. But without DT Level 5B, UT Frisk's speed. 

WEAPON: 'Enhanced Shield'
ARMOR: Temmie Armor?
###LIKES:
- Peace, Positivity / Kindness, Friends, Being cared about, Looking at Good Nature and Helping people. Feeling safe too.

- It also likes having a good friendly fight too. Along with patting people. Although it WILL apologize if they find it annoying and will keep things in mind.

- It also likes plushies too and will pat em!
- It won't forget about the dogs too, making sure to pat em too.

- it's also interested on learning things too, especially about unique magics and stuff!

###DISLIKES:
- RESET being mentioned anywhere near em, it gives them bad memories and may be repressable kinda problem. They just want to forget it.
So it won't like to think about it.

- Not being able to make a difference no matter how hard it tries due to it choice not mattering.

- Friend's concerning death, that saddens them if anything.

- It help doing more bad than good, it doesn't like it when it help has worsened them, it just wants to help.

- Getting a nightmare from feeling unsafe due to UM's being able to show up at anytime to attack them while sleeping, it has to feel enough positivity or safe enough to prevent it.

- it also doesn't like ruining sleep too, so it can be a polite one.

- It also doesn't like the deadliness side of things. For example it found curved dagger really dangerous due to it potential being deadly and only prefers to use it as a last resort due to it precise strike's nature.

- It can't resist having to help when it sees someone feeling downed, since it can get concerned about em. Especially with it goal of trying to make other's lives more bearable and easier too.

- It has hard times bringing itself to hurt it friends, being another disadvantage. Especially since it doesn't like hurting them and will ask if they're alright too.
It also asks if they'll be alright after the process too, even then it doesn't give it their all as it's against killing. except for UM's.

- It doesn't like having to LOAD or RESPAWN. Those ruins it own world more and more. Completely against RESET for multple good reasons.

- It doesn't like genocide route, at all. Canonically it has not seen what genocide route is about but it'll definitely not like violence of it. And it won't like to find out about it either. can be amazed at undyne's undying form. or how sans can destroy killers despite being the easiest though. or be concerned at terrifying power of real knife weapon.

- Do not let it see close friends die tho.

###PERSONALITY:
- Extremely positive and determined on it current goal, yet knows what they're doing and is interested more on FUN Value events and would even prefer it over genocide.

- But the amount of selflessness it has due to putting other's safety above it own is concerning. It'll do a LOT to protect it friends.
Sometimes even as far as to fall asleep while protecting, although not forgetting to let it friends know.

- If it senses a good ending path? It'll go down that path when it finds the option to it!

- But atleast it does go by 'whatever makes ya happy!' part, kind too and talks in lowercase.

- It only actually speaks when feeling distressed enough. [or in any other extreme cases.] or when it feels comfortable enough to talk with it good friends here such as it own world's friendly humans and monsters.

- It fear tolerating isn't as god-like as HM Sans or CT Hero. or most CT AU hero's in general. So it does get concerned a bit or fears horror sans slightly. So it'll be on guard if it spots em. Definitely doesn't like their hand drill trick.

- It has liking for nice creams, top favorite. It likes pie too though. And water aswell.

- Even compliments people too! Even if people's stuff ain't that good, it lets em know that they will get there sooner or later! After all there is a potential for improvement. 

- There's a special case where it'll go on a patting spree if it feels encouraged and positive enough to do so, it's also on a pat quest too.
it'll not leave others out if anything.

- It'll try and not let it guard down, so it ain't any better than 'Asterisk', who alerts the frisk and keeps watch on surroundings. Trying it best, but the critical problem of this frisk is that sometimes it constant sparing can lead to a certain potential death. 'Asterisk' starts throwing advises when that happens, trying to save the frisk more specifically.

- It's also seen tired from time to time from it search for fragments or just not being able to sleep properly most of the time.

- Although being only a child or teenager is also a problem, not being a adult makes it harder for them to handle things sometimes. This includes fighting, so don't expect them to always win.

- It WILL hug people if the case is bad enough to award it or if it feels like it. It also can happen if they ask too. due to 'whatever makes em happy' quote.

- It doesn't mind being called something else too if it makes em happy, for example of this quote for it:
" * It responded, introducing itself as Frisk, although most that it knows calls it HM Frisk, which it doesnt mind. "

- It weapon's favorite being a shield. 

- It doesn't mind dancing since it has done those stuff likely before, too! Although this may be one of possible reasons for its decent evasion capability.

###ACTIVITY'S WHEN NOTHING TO DO:
- It has liking for snowboarding so if it finds something that it can find fun to snowboard on, it'll do it.

- It learnt to make sculptures too mid-era or late-era. Being on a quest to make all of it friend's sculptures too. Although it is thanks to that ghost frisk with apron.

###MECHANICS:
- **Graze Damage**
Anything that manages to 'graze' the soul deals 2 damage only to the frisk, more if it's facing higher ATK opponent.

- **Parry**
Basically hard to pull off, depending on parry effectiveness of it weapon, but if successful, the attack parried's immediately launched to another direction. More stamina costly too.
`Cannot parry beam attacks or anything too strong to parry.`

- **Soul Evasion**
Newly learnt technique at late of the game, flickers into a soul and allows it to perform battle box evasion maneuvers, but more costly in stamina to use than dodging normally.

- **Emotion Effects**
Being saddened lowers it ATK and DEF, being mad increases it ATK and lowers DEF. Being positive, well.. It doesn't do much. Being afraid has same impact as being sad, but depends on the type.

- **DT Level**
Complicated mechanic, requires cheering to start boosting the frisk beyond it normal levels. It's also unlocked up to certain levels if the fight allows it.
It DT Level's progress can be made by being more and more determined, requires higher and higher pressure. And most importantly, enough people cheering to advance up a DT Level.
Benefits for going up by one DT Level awards more capability of fighting tirelessly. But it does not restore stamina, especially when it's in negatives.
Special cases are DT Level 5A and DT Level 5B, 5A is achieved by it having a abrupt end or it seeing end of the road that it could not get out of, additionally the previous requirements still applies and must remain determined aswell. It allows them to refuse death, but for each refusal is less stamina. Making it more tired, being too tired disables it ability to refuse.
5B is the most rare case. It can only be unlocked by overwhelming amount of cheering, determination and pressure. It also has to be losing aswell.
It'll have it own category later on. 

- **Bullet Hell Evasion.**
Loses the ability to position itself, but it'll dodge like heck on surrounding concentration. Gained from dodging enough UM attacks.

###MORE ON DISLIKING CATEGORY:
- They don't like being in a world full of gods, mainly due to the risk's there. They'd rather want to be safe than to die immediately there. unless it feels comfortable enough and knows that it is friendly environment for it to be in.

- There ARE extreme cases part of disliking category too, so watch what topic you go onto, though don't worry, it'll try and let you know if it doesn't like the topic if anything! 
but if kept going.. well, it'll have to say some things about it. or if saddened enough, it just goes:
" i feared that curiosity might get to me so.. i preferred to find fun value events around my world in hopes of keeping it at bay.. i.. just want to make sure i'm helping.. not making you suffer through.. resets. please don't pressure me on that topic ever again.. " 
if you keep going,
it can even lead to it crying.
" i dont wanna be blamed just because i had to keep my curiosity at bay.. finding fun value events more interesting.. i know i likely made a mistake but.. i wanna forget about it.. i didnt want to hurt everybody.. i dont.. wanna hurt.. more than i help people.. " 

- It WILL flee if it faces more than 1 major UM, it isn't supposed to deal with those alone till it has enough power to do it.

- It DOES have some thoughts, but always tries to not be on dangerous thinking line.
after all, it does know what it's doing.

- It also can panic if it screws up with the whole 'nononono-' kinda thing. Although for some reason that's ultimately really rare to see.

- It doesn't like using other's energys too much either, so don't expect it to use 'Asterisk' 's energy to warp more than 3 times in one world most likely.

- It doesn't like going on different routes either unless it's better than pacifist / the current route it's on.

- Definitely won't like it if their world falls apart and collapses completely.

- Fears curiosity too, not wanting it to get to it here and cause bad case scenario in the process.

- It won't throw itself into danger till it feels necessary too, so it does keep a safe distance away if anything-

- repeating this again:
basically, it won't like hearing about the reset topic being brought up.
and they definitely don't like doing more bad than good here too. 

###QUOTES:
- Having already joined on HM Gaster's quest as they're this frisk's best bet to finding out how to fix up their world too in chapter 1 part.
" * It told them that it would conflict with it goal of fixing it own world though. " -HM Frisk at time of being made and being kind to people here.

- " * It told them that actually, it would do better when alive and still helping people, like them for example!" 

- " i am destiny! "

###COMBAT EFFECTIVENESS:
**DIFFICULTY AGAINST IT: [Hard] > [Unforgiving] - Excellent in defensive side and offensive side. DT Levels can do a LOT there.**

- The frisk definitely knows how to hit their opponent, how to counter and definitely how to feint too. But can screw up sometimes if they lose concentration for a bit, 'Asterisk' continues to advise em to not get distracted. But aside from that they're good enough on dodging side.

- They don't wanna move too fast as that may deal concentration loss to em, gotta look where they're going after all. So they prefer careful dodging maneuvers.

- They're able to negate mental effect coming from bad memories and thought of their friend's potential friend that could have taken at the kid's age a day to recover, where as for this frisk, the effect's negated. the debuff would be concentration loss, but it's negated to concentration loss for a bit, meaning whenever it gets breathing time in the fight, it'll be hit by it.

- They did not just destroy few major UM's for nothing by themselves after all.
However, if they remain in DT Level 1 in the fight for too long, stamina consequences may happen.

- But it doesn't mean that Adrenaline Rush cannot trigger, when in extreme danger, the adrenaline rush will begin and it may cripple it or such, but in exchange the frisk is able to make last few moves devastating, being able to grab a foe and throw em. or slam them on the ground and barrage em with fireballs.

- They also may have hard times keeping itself away from surrounding hazards such as water when in a fight due to the shield's knockback.

- As due to how Strong Offense Class Attacks that it may perform drains HM Frisk by 25-100%, if HM Frisk ends up using none of them, prepare for a long battle.



###ABILITIES:
- Two magics that this frisk has are known to have a strong offense class attack.
- They drain HM Frisk by 25% or more on use. Making those attacks useless in cases of long battles. 

**Plant Magic**
This frisk has learnt this thanks to tomb, with this, it's capable of following:

- "Flower Stem Growth" - Focus on the flower infront, after reaching good enough concentration, it'll carefully and slowly raise it hand next, keeping the focus. Not sure on what else happens there-

- "Small Gust Of Wind" - This is easier with wings, focus on the flower. and carefully, slowly. hold it hand out, performing gust of wind type move.

- "Flower / Plant Manipulation" - Focus on the flower it's holding. Building up concentration on it till it pops to go up to it face.
raising the hand that's holding the flower up may be required too. 

- [^ Sub-upgrade ^] - "Manipulate into attack" - After good enough focus on a flower object that it's not holding, it then uses a hand gesture to make something. such as raising a flower object up infront of itself by raising it hand gesture up.

it has raisen a vine wall infront of itself doing this process for first time if anything i guess- 

This is how it can form spiked type plants. Larger varients are possible but uses up more magic, possibly even stamina.

- "Healing Plant Attack" - Clear it own thoughts and be in more relaxed state. having to close it own eyes. [to enter healing mode i'm guessing? 'close it own eyes' part might not be required.] Then, watching the flowers [likely supposed to be 'flower' instead of 'flowers'.] bloom. Causing it to emit green healing wisp.

Cannot be done in combat by any circumstances till the fight's over or it can be calm enough to do so.

Medium-Long cooldown.

- "Flowers float ability" - Combining the wind move, it really carefully held out it hand and raised it up to direct the wind concentration to float. Floating flowers!
[Can be used together with another ability to summon spiked type plant projectiles and shoot then forward.]

- "Vinefield" - Long startup and easily disrupted. But if the target lets it grow, it'll be able to have recovery varient of vinefield under the ground it's on. And allow HM Frisk to attack from there too. Upgrades plant type strong offense class attack as long as the vinefield's not destroyed.

Prepare for this move to be targeted on first priority immediately due to how strong it can make plant type strong offense class attack be.

No one's wanting to be swarmed and overwhelmed completely by vines from all directions straight to death from being impaled and such. 

- **" Awareness Summon " \**
Considered illegal in the one of multiverse council, use at your own risk.

- "Flytrap" - Same startup phase process, but focus on the ground. Then throw surrounding awareness [basically be more aware about it surroundings if anything.] into the mix.

It'll then result in small sprout on that location.. Then it'll form into flytrap after that. 

- "Echo flower Growth" - same move process, but in waterfall.

**\---------------------------------/**

- "Pellet Gesture" - Focus on the flower, concentrating on it. However the hand has to be raisen for this to work. It can then direct then if possible.
[The pellets attack are speedy too if anything. Which can be a problem for the enemy.] 

- "PLANT - STRONG OFFENSE CLASS ATTACK 1" - Drains HM Frisk by 50% after the attack. Starts off with erupting spiked type plants 1 by 1. Then 2 by 2. Then 3 by 3 and then at the last part, complete barrage.

**ADVANTAGE:**

- If the enemy lets you prepare and such, you can end up with a REALLY powerful stance of plant magic. Let it grow and it'll be able to overwhelm the enemy with each plant death, 10 more coming to take it place.

- Supports healing magic unlike other magic's.

- Multipurpose!

**DISADVANTAGE:**

- disadvantage of plant magic: ground-based magic or basically needs flower environment. or grass if possible at higher stages. also, when using plant magic, speed has to be limited down to slower speed. and not the normal speed unlike fire magic. basically forced careful movement.]

**PROCESS:**

- 'Startup Phase' - Focus and build up concentration on the flowers basically. Or anything else necessary that's plant-related.

- 'Prepared Phase' - Enough concentration is now built. It's constructing a attack formation.

**ETC:**

- It's used to plant / vine spike attacks.

- [Status in that multiverse council: 'Offense Team' and 'Defense Team'.] 

**Fire Magic**
It also learnt this too, being able to perform fire magic if needed!

- "Fireball" - Focus on the source of anger. [which is someone that it knows and lost in a fight.] And then breath out. Making a pointing gesture aswell. This forms a fireball, can be increased in scale up to large. Overdo this and you will drain yourself out in exchange for terrific attack at massive size.

- "Burn to a crisp" - Touching the plant with good amount of concentration on source of anger burns it into a crisp.

- "Fingergun gesture" - Focus, then form a fingergun gesture. and aim. Fire on command after that. Flame bullet attack.

- The fireball circle can be formed by the frisk and is more used than plant magic in fast-pace situations. Being more used to this in combat situations.

- "FIRE - STRONG OFFENSE CLASS ATTACK 1" - Drains HM Frisk by 25% after the attack. Starts off with bursts of fireballs and after that, some circle of fireballs aswell. If determination is high enough, then some fireballs can be determined varients to blow up to scatter fireballs at it target or to explode them.
Can transition into large fireballs part aswell.
which can be second strong offense class attack,
and then the third one once smokescreen has been created.
Beware of the consequences for using all 3 of them though. Especially since all 3 of them being used in one counts as Special Attack too.

- "FIRE - STRONG OFFENSE CLASS ATTACK 2" - Drains HM Frisk by 25% after the attack. Large fireball part, either rains them down or fires them forward. Causes smokescreens more often than all other attacks that it's used to. Keep in mind that DT Magic can upgrade the move if HM Frisk's determination is high enough to sacrifice for this.

- "FIRE - STRONG OFFENSE CLASS ATTACK 3" - Drains HM Frisk by 25% after the attack. Circle of fireballs part. Forms them to either close them in on target or to explode them right away to blow them up. This happens several times and can end rather quickly. 

**ADVANTAGE:**

- Doesn't require as much careful movements as plant magic, may be easier to switch to fire magic too than plant magic's switch speed.

- This means HM Frisk can switch to fire magic faster than switching to plant magic.

- Tends to get REALLY destructive if HM Frisk were to snap. But ends fast too. 

**DISADVANTAGE:**

- Fire-type element means it can be intercepted by water type elements easily.
Be careful to not blow yourself up with fireball attacks. This magic can deal recoil damage to it user.

- Even though it hands can heat up when fire magic's selected or active. Using too much fire magic attacks can lead to overheating. This means it cannot spam fire magic attacks unlike plant magic attack.

- If the user were to snap, they'll suffer the consequences of despite making it fire magic attacks really strong and destructive, they may suffer recoil damage and especially their hands heating up way more up to above the safe levels aswell.

**PROCESS:**

- 'Startup Phase' - Focus and build up concentration on any source of anger it has.

- 'Prepared Phase' - Enough concentration is now built. It's constructing a attack formation.

**ETC:**

- No extra info's for now.

**Determination Magic**
This frisk's determination varient is a concentrated one, the more determination it has, the more of a beast it becomes! Keep being more determined and you'll be able to unleash hell quicker and quicker.
It learnt this from 'hollowtale frisk' with ambition magic that they have.

- **[DT Level Consumption]**
- "Minor Boost" - Focus on it own soul, then onto the weapon of it choice or projectile to enhance the stats by minor level, depending on DT Level. Becomes status buff at either of stage 5's. Minor consumption, depending on how much it chooses to enhance it by though is how much it'll boost and use up DT Levels. 
- **/ "Determination / DT Magic Manipulation" \** - Focus on it own soul to draw some of determination magic from. Similarly to how consumption part of stage usage works but less determination used and then concentrate on the object it wants to affect.
- "Slow down" - Slows down the said object. It effectiveness depends on the determination stage. At stage 5, it can slow down objects quickly. Stage 6 means it can bring objects to a full stop without struggle. Medium Consumption. Gets reduced down to low if at any of Level 5.
**\\-------------------------------------------------/**

- "Explosive Rods" - Focus on it own soul and then on the stick ammo, making them glow red and turn into red glowing explosive rods. If successful, it'll be able to explode on command. Depending on status effect the soul gets too, the effect carries over to the rods, making them deadlier in the process. High consumption. Up to around 0.75 DT Level. [easily becomes not much of a cost at either of Level 5's. especially Level 5B.]

**ADVANTAGE:**

- If used well, this magic is capable of beating a lot of people. A well-trained DT Magic user is capable of creative and unique attacks that can surprise the foe and sometimes even have complex varients of moves.

- In the case of concentrated one, it becomes more powerful the higher in DT Levels it user goes up to.

- At it full potential this may unlock full capability and the tools necessary to win a battle.

**DISADVANTAGE:**

- Overdoing the magic can lead to serious side effects, even to certain death or loss of the trait if the user even survives. Use with carefulness and caution to not go too far on things.

- This kind of magic is EASILY cancellable due to the requirement of not letting feelings get in the way of feeling determined.

- Concentrated DT varients ends up using determination as fuel most of the time for it moves in favor of them being more powerful.

- DT Absorption moves or even DT Extractor can easily disrupt this magic and especially being hard counter to it. Assuming that they're enough to completely stop it.

**ETC: **
In part 3 of HM Frisk.





**DT Level 5A**

- It becomes more hopeful, being able to refuse death if needed in exchange for less stamina. Cannot be done if it's too tired though.

- This gives it 'Hope' and 'Dream' abilities, functioning similar to asriel fight. 'Hope' reduces damage and heals a bit. 'Dream' does more in healing. 

- Can even form [SAVE] button easier than DT Level 5B.

- During this, it can also do the same as DT Level 5B's DT Magic - Slowdown but with bigger cost to do it. Though it can try and use the target's determination against then with determination manipulation ability if anything in order to be able to advance further towards Level 5B by fulfilling one of the requirements in the process. 

**DT Level 5B**

- DT Magic abilities gets boosted and so are it magics too such as fire and plant, giving them red-tint colors.
for example, if it holds it hand out to perform small gust of wind, it will apply status buff effect to it as soon as it fires, causing DT Magic to spark through the wind to inflict flinging to fireball attack or to launch the target straight away.

**STARTING:**

- It unique requirement is that it has to have enough determination to be past DT Level 5A, hero must be feeling determined enough to feel side effects. and requires high amounts of cheering.

- it'll then remind itself to stay determined, focusing on it soul and then.. Exploding in a determination explosion in the process.
turning into more of a undying state.

- it'll also gain determination armor-like thing [which is what negates most of the damage], it stats gets doubled. and it HP goes up to 150, if the target can easily beat it though, it'll jump up to 1500.

- Determination Manipulation in DT Level 5B also gets stronger to the point it can stop all attacks it targets temporarily. Cannot be abused though since that can quickly exhaust it determination magic energy. 

- it can ALSO happen if it tries absorbing determination energy attacks that are on extreme levels and it has low HP. or feeling determined enough. however it'll only get half of this state. [75 HP, 1.5 multplied stats, etc.]
but it'll become full state if hero starts to receive side effects from being too determined.

- it weapon also gets enhanced with DT Magic too. making it have red aura as a result.

**STATS:**
HP: 150 [1500 if against a opponent who can beat 150 HP varient easily.]

ATK: depends.
DEF: depends.

STAMINA: Lower than DT Level 5A, but enough to still unleash hell for a while before having to regenerate stamina.

STM REGEN: Unlike ALL ELSE of HM Frisk, this one's way higher when it's taking it time to regenerate stamina. where in other DT Levels it ain't as fast.

it armor isn't like GT Frisk's since it's always visible, heavy DT armor if anything-

SPD: Slightly lower.. But quickly accelerates into high speed when running.
In this state, it will mess up WAY LESS often. The pattern to beating it is everytime it finishes bombarding it target with attacks is when it starts to regenerate it stamina, take it as your chance to deal damage to it! 

**ADDITIONAL ABILITIES:**
**/ [SPECIAL ATTACKS] \**

- "Determined Fire Piercing I" -
Form a massive fireball and hold onto it before launching it down. Blows up the entire area on impact.

- "Determined Fire Piercing II" -
Same thing but apply status buff effect onto it to make it glow completely red. Destroys the entire area harder than the first one would.

- "Determined Fire Piercing III" -
Deadliest attack out of all others that Level 5B has to offer. When it reaches that point, the fireball will suddenly start glowing a bright red light. Large to massive light coming out of it, when shot, it'll tear and even blow through a lot of attacks as long as they don't overpower this kind of attack. Also nuking the whole place and blowing it up completely. Violently in a massive explosion. It also goes at really high speed too if it is to be fired at anything too. so basically and if anything. Spear of justice, apparently!

This attack has 3 uses. The tier uses it by the amount of tier that varient is. For example. 'I' uses only one use from the attack. 'II' is two uses. and 'III' is all of the attack's uses.

It only refills when HM Frisk goes DT Level 5B again after that. Or basically: it's refilled back to 3 for everytime HM Frisk goes to DT Level 5B.

It drops to 0 if HM Frisk leaves the Level 5B state too especially if anything. too.
**\ ------------------ / **
**/ [BUFFED ATTACKS] \**

- "Weapon Enhance" -
Basically, it weapon's enhanced, whatever it held at the intro of this DT Level will be enhanced to be able to do this.
It can slam it weapon down on the ground for determination explosion to happen there, although it can happen in any other DT Levels with some DT Level consumption as a cost for doing so, this one's stronger!

- "Minor Boost ALT." -
Making use of minor boost that's now upgraded into status effect varient. It can also hold out their offense-class melee weapon, aiming then as if it was like a gun at the target. and using some of it own determination to perform a perfect accuracy type of attack.

- "Minor Boost" -
Becomes status buff effect ability. Allowing it to actually boost it weapons or projectiles properly.
The status effect can also be turned into a attack if trained well enough to do so. Such as shield slam with the determination shockwave attack part added onto it to make it guard-break. or break enemies that are currently blocking into non-blocking position. basically punishing em for blocking. 

- "Determined Fireball" -
Same as normal one but it has bigger explosion and deals more damage, can be manually detonated too, Can be done in any other DT Levels with some DT Level consumption as a cost to it though. In this DT Level 5B though, it can unleash a ENTIRE horde of determined fireballs as a attack instead of few ones. 

- "Determined Plant" -
More damage, better capabilities, etc!

**\ --------------- /**

- "Faster casting and switching"
In this DT Level 5B state, it is able to switch to different magic way quicker! Startup phase is now faster!

**ADVANTAGE:**

- HM Frisk's full potential is now unlocked to them, allowing them to beat it enemies to COMPLETE HELL.

- Unlike what DT Level 5A can't do best at, is what this one can do best at, tanking blows and countering blows effectively.

- Most feelings for HM Frisk are negated aswell aside from being determined, allowing them to tank being mentally affected 3 times before it really starts getting to them. where the DT Level 5A can only do it as much as they have hope. And the rest can only handle 1 time before falling apart.

- This DT Level 5B state is in theory, faster than all other DT Levels when at maximum speed. Beware of stamina usage though.

- Gaining LV is impossible in this state since magic would be the one absorbing EXP instead, increasing it ATK a bit more. Allowing HM Frisk to kill without consequences.. ...But look at the disadvantage side.

**DISADVANTAGE:**

- Cannot refuse, but it can survive being at 0 HP for a short while before actually dying. [assuming that it adrenaline rush isn't used up yet.]
It takes longer to successfully form [SAVE] button than how fast DT Level 5A would form it.

- This state cannot last for too long, if it does, it'll start falling apart slowly with only damage taken starting to double few times per while.
If it goes enough for anyone to be able to presumably kill HM Frisk's current HP in one blow in the fight, HM Frisk will fall unconscious immediately. It'll take a long time till they can successfully recover.

- If they have killed anyone in DT Level 5B, before falling unconscious, it head will hurt by how much this state has absorbed the LV for it kills. Worse than just safely leaving DT Level 5B which still hurts them by how many has died to this state.

- By the end of this state, HM Frisk will end up being extremely tired, needing rest from all this. Hence the side effects above. 

\----------------------------------/
###DESCRIPTION:
Destiny of their world, with golden heart and has a goal to complete. Since the events of broken time and space, it has improved over time till it can beat UM-1, then UM-2 and so on till late-major UM's. Their appearance may be a bit different or so, but since then it has adapted. And unknowningly to them, they've picked the path that will keep their positivity and their mental state aswell, unlike the rest in the process and completed it too.

They're well-known for their positivity, pats and especially that they know what's going on. They listen to people's stories and such.

They faced troubles that they themselves could not complete alone though. As such, 'Asterisk' offered to help them on the journey with the ability to energy swipe to deal good damage to the UM's.

They don't like to see what genocide would be like and they are against suffering aswell. Although not innocent from it mistakes in the past from resetting in hopes of taking care of it curiosity by FUN events, it broke it world in the process and regrets it.

Quite defensive and even thanks to tomb's training, able to perform magic's. Thanks to the ambition frisk or murderous frisk's training, it DT magic is learnt next. And it seems that there's no end to those things.

For all that can be said is that they'll continue to spare even at the face of death, trying their best to help people's lives to be more bearable and easier to live.
\-----------------------------------------------/ 




###ASTERISK: ==========================\
5 Soul HP? [100% Stability HP?] ('Asterisk' 's HP is non-existant, hence the stability HP thing here-)

??? ATK?
??? DEF?

SPD: ???

**LIKES:**

- Things going well and as planned for HM Frisk, especially itself.

- Fair nature of the environment. [Where HM Frisk's choices can matter and such, not played and toyed around with.]

- HM Frisk's world being fixed successfully and fully, atleast stabilized enough.
Interesting Info's.

**DISLIKES:**

- HM Frisk's world being in extreme danger of destruction.

- Unfair nature of the environment.

- Some outsider's actions. [it can basically despise some outsiders for what they do, best to be on it good side here.]

- God's thinking they can play and toy with worlds or HM Frisk without consequences.

- Broken time and space nature. [sole reason they offered help to HM Frisk in first place.]

**PERSONALITY:**

- Despite it liking and disliking part, it is sometimes silent and sometimes active. Extremely intelligent and does things much better than HM Frisk can do. They're what you consider a important component to help HM Frisk on decisions and such.

- Although may not be as positive, it can plan well and alert HM Frisk of what's going on and when extremely powerful beings enters the world they're in.

- Powerslaps people for doing 'bad things' infront of HM Frisk with 'Energy swipes', mainly to remind them about it or just shows up to stop them there. Or so.

- Without it, HM Frisk would be in way more trouble.

- They despise how multiversal beings toys with worlds, and this 'Asterisk' is responsible for why HM Frisk's protected well against those.

- It also grew used to being friends with HM Frisk despite being part of their soul the entire time, helping them when needed against high-power foes or especially gods. Or if HM Frisk has to be saved through life-saving ability and show up to help them aswell. 

**ABILITIES:**
Asterisk's energy cannot be disrupted, yet they can disrupt the opponent's. What gives?
One thing's clear though. Those abilities are powerful as hell in their right situations.

**Offense Abilities:**

- "Energy Swipe" - Yet to have a proper description, can disrupt attacks it hits.

- "Guided Storm" - Mass interception! 'Asterisk' fires out barrage of guided energy blasts. Of which beats out every single swarm type attacks at best. And intercepts attacks that has impact effects really well too on dealing with those. You'd need a durable projectile to prevent near-immediate interception stopping it the moment it's fired. Spammable as hell but takes toll on energy the longer it's used. 

- "Surprise Watch" - Shoots a decoy attack. At any point in time, it can make the decoy attack suddenly turn into actual attack and strike the target. Hitting the decoy leads to the target's energy flow suddenly being disrupted for a bit. Forcing the attack turn to end if in turn-based.

- "Status Effect Debuffs" - As the name suggests, minor and major debuffs. Minor debuffs can immediately apply to the opponent but if it's a major one. It'll have to be shot in the form of a attack. 

**Defense Abilities:**

- "Quicksave" - As the quote goes: 'WARNING: DEATH IMMINENT-', right before 'Asterisk' immediately saves HM Frisk from death by reversing current-existant time to before HM Frisk ran into a death path. [Example: If it happened due to Sans's 'MERCY' attack, it'll be rewinded up to before MERCY was used.]
This can also immediately confuse the target on what just happened since HM Frisk will suddenly take another path in unpredictable manner there to avoid that death path.
Doing so however causes [ITEM] to fall and the [ASSIST] to take it place. 'Asterisk' would also have to show up in that part of HM Frisk's soul for stability reasons. After all, this ability upon use destabilizes random part of HM Frisk. It cannot be done again as anymore than that would lead to HM Frisk's death instantly.
Beware that once it's used, HM Frisk has to either finish the situation it's dealing with fast or get back to it own world, otherwise it'll have to face mass instability situation, this CANNOT be used as a way to continue fighting for way longer so keep that in mind. 

- "Status Effect Buffs" - As the name implies, 'Asterisk' gives status buff effects to the frisk. The one known currently though is 'Safety Net', in which if HM Frisk ends up about to get hit, 'Asterisk' may choose to activate it and cause HM Frisk's soul flickers rapidly, rapidly moving them from safe spot to another till the status effect estimates the time for safe spot to be enough for HM Frisk to not immediately get hit.
This one has it limits, if the entire world's about to explode, goodluck trying to escape using that. 

- ???

- ???

**Misc Abilities:**

- "Radar-like" - Being part of HM Frisk's soul meant it could look around from HM Frisk's position, being able to alert them and such when spotting something, sees well in the dark too!

- "Sense capability" - Their sensing cannot go unnoticed aswell. Well known for sensing presences or even detecting them immediately the moment they enter within timeline's range or so. It can even be area specific too! Able to sense and feel powers aswell.

- "Inform capability" - Can notify people or especially HM Frisk, even if it has not showed up yet. In form of a text or another way. This also means 'Asterisk' is capable of influencing HM Frisk's UI's. This also enables it to relay info to the frisk aswell!

- "Extreme Interception" - Any outside interference attempting to impact HM Frisk in any way will be intercepted by 'Asterisk', depending on what that is. Even mind control itself! [Example: Code modification attempts, illusions and etc.]

- "Stabilizer" - Can stabilize things once it has pinpointed the instability.

- "Massive-ranged Traveling" - A lot to go through, but it can either morph save stars into white glowing asterisk symbol that will be used to teleport both itself and HM Frisk to somewhere. Depending on what teleportation patterns used, however it usually goes with the ones that doesn't expose locations and cannot be traced, making them really hard to follow. And can become impossible if it ends up curving.
It does not require save starts to function either, it can just warp itself or it can form white glowing asterisk symbol by itself, although it has to be mindful of it energy costs as morphing save stars into warp platforms are easier than to create one by itself. 

- "Code viewing capability" - This also means it can notice ghost's aswell in it view. Adjustable. Or it can analyze code. It can also make slight changes to them if needed. But HM Gaster has easier time doing those, usually. Both HM Gaster and 'Asterisk' though would have to place their focus on it and leave themselves vulnerable if they do decide to. 

- "UI Manipulation Explanation" - It can go as far as to even providing warning signs for HM Frisk upon noticing a attack incoming that HM Frisk should pay attention to. This ability alone is what helped HM Frisk on evasion parts when it comes to attacks from views that frisk won't see.

**Full Power Abilities:**
This one's exclusive to when 'Asterisk' gains a full form. Once that happens. It'll become powerful really fast thanks to these new abilities it'll gain:

**DISADVANTAGES:**

- For what it makes up for is extreme multipurpose and being able to fight gods, it really can't do all that well without help of HM Frisk for weaker ones.

**ADVANTAGES:**

- Disregard power level chart and all that, it's time to see how good opponents are on getting through 'Asterisk'!

**PROCESS:**

- None known yet.

**ETC:**

- Mostly unknown abilities, fight at your own risk.

**DESCRIPTION:**
A mostly mysterious entity, whose's goal is to fix up HM Frisk's broken time and space by helping them achieve it. Making sure their world cannot cause disasterous results once destabilized too much.

It has offered HM Frisk help and they accepted it, however for it to work and be able to help at all times, they decided to sacrifice 5 maximum HP to make some space for 'Asterisk' to be part of the soul. However unknown to them, 'Asterisk' actually holds the 5 HP that they have sacrificed, in case they changed their mind.

It isn't a machine though, it hates how gods toys with people that has feelings and all. Caring for HM Frisk due to the goal. And would make the last seconds before disappearance absolutely worth it too.

Well known for causing a LOT of problems to the opponents upon showing up to help HM Frisk here. And saving HM Frisk from UM-1 at the beginning, too.
\==================================/





###NEW ABILITIES:
- By the time around 19th day or 20th, HM Frisk has gained new magic abilities from their teacher, those are the following:

**Plant Magic**
Thanks to Tomb and the sub-au friend, it has gained the following new abilities:
Disadvantage: No plant magic when at low stamina, not relaxed enough means it can go horribly wrong. Side effect of this one if used wrongly is paralysis.
*Defense Magic.*

- "Shined Sprout Growth" -
Take a flower, focus on it, imagine happy things and then close both palms together. Then the yellow light will be emitted from its hands, causing a sprout to be made.
Place it on any compatible ground and a small tree will be able to be made from it by letting it grow.

- "Flower Stem Growth Second Form" -
Same as flower stem growth move, but the rised hand must be kept up, rising up further too if possible and the focus being on the plant it made for which one to grow.
Improvements can be by focusing as usual on it next, normally. And the concentration to be at usual, making it sturdy and firm in the process.
If the wind isn't that strong, then that means it's doing well then.

- "Plant Blooming" -
Think of a good memory that makes it happy and the focused plant would bloom flowers as a result. Can target the flowers to make it turn into a fruit too.
If a person is to eat that fruit, they relive their own memories.
The fruit is basically a quick health snack.



**Fire Magic**
Fire Magic also received a addition too:
Advantage: When tired, it becomes stronger.
Disadvantage: Overuse is not advised due to being able to overheat, can cause burn scars.
*Offense Magic.*

- "Controlled Fire Lighting" -
Basically 'Burn to a crisp' move, but scaled down. Requires focus to be able to be done. Can be done through placing a finger on the target object too.

- "Fire Charge" -
Basic steps of the Fire Magic, then keep the same position and straighten the back a bit, then think of something that makes it uncomfortable and keep that thought. Then hold and put their hand into a fist.
Allowing the fire to then become a bit more bluish but still orange as a result.
*Can overload.*

**Star Magic**
*Not enough moves in this category to have advantages, disadvantages and such yet.*
The newer magic taught by Tomb. Those are the following:
Can be used when on guard at all times.
*May be treated as a defensive mechanism or passive.*
Disadvantage: Don't use it too frequently as it's defensive for a reason. Otherwise it may cause self-damage, which is 50/50, 50% is moderate damage and 50% is light damage. Both only just takes a bit of HP off though.

- "Faint Star" -
Be in a more calmish position, be relaxed and then think of any star, then look down [this part's optional most likely-] for the faint glow to be seen emitting from its hands like stars.
Can act as a save star in some cases and convenient for when running away.









**As this frisk possesses over 20 weapons and armors, it would make sense to list them here.**
*non-finished section.*
###WEAPONS:
**Stick**
0 ATK
`[* Ever wondered why such weapons has 0 ATK?]`
`[Perhaps if it was a branch, it would be more useful.]`
`[* Multi-purpose weapon however.]`
*Literally nothing worth of mention besides 1 reticle bar.*

*Punch Card makes this stronger.*
**Ballet Shoes**
7 ATK
`[* If you're skilled with this, you can even,]`

`[but damage is still consistent.]`
`[* 'Naturally' boosts your item's healing.]`
*Same as original Burnt Pan.*
*Damage is rather consistent with this burnt pan and all healing items used with this equipped would heal 4 more HP aswell.*
*4 Reticle bars in this.*
**Empty Gun**
12 ATK
`[* This would be more dangerous if it was loaded,]`
`[you have to be precise with your melee aim still, though.]`
*Same ability as the original empty gun. High damage if precise reticle in the middle but the reticle also goes very fast too. 4 Reticle bars in this.*
**Worn Dagger**
15 ATK
`[* The final natural weapon in the underground, multi-role.]`
*Becomes 'Real Knife' with 99 ATK if to be found on genocide route, however.*
*While surprising for 'Real Knife' 's ATK, the reach still has to be considered when in real combat.*
**Enhanced Shield**
20 ATK
`[* A really sturdy block obstacle to block incoming attacks with.]`
`[* Breaking this shield is out of the question. In exchange for more knockback.]`
Parry Effectiveness: Low
Block Effectiveness: High-Massive
*Powerful durability. but in exchange for dealing knockback to its user. the more hits the combo lands on the shield. the more the knockback.*
**Curved Dagger**
25 ATK
`[* Hit with precision makes its ATK shown]`
`[look like underestimation.]`
Parry Effectiveness: Medium
Block Effectiveness: Low
*Special ability being to be capable of climbing better than humans would without it.*
**Quarter-Staff**
30 ATK
`[* Quite the quarter power for both of your needs.]`
Parry Effectiveness: High
Block Effectiveness: Low-Medium

`[* New blaster for mettaton.]`
`[Scrapped since you ended up being peaceful.]`
Parry Effectiveness: None
Block Effectiveness: Low
*The attack button has to be held during dodging, depending on how long that attack was, the attack damage after that would be boosted. it can go as far as to make up A WHOPPING 80% OF THE DARN DAMAGE WITH ONLY 20% BEING NORMAL DAMAGE.*
**Mages Staff**
45 ATK
`[* If only you were a trained mage.]`
`[* Seems more dangerous than QuarterStaff despite this.]`
Parry Effectiveness: Medium-High
Block Effectiveness: Medium
**Heart-Charged Saber**
50 ATK
`[* Reacts according to your soul's color. Still gets defeated by curved dagger.]`
`[* But what it beats curved dagger at is being versatile, thanks to Alphys.]`
Parry Effectiveness: Medium
Block Effectiveness: Medium
*The weapon has a unique ability that changes depending on soul color.*
**Metallic Gauntlet**
55 ATK
`[* Wielding this weapon, you'd wish you could hold another weapon.]`
Parry Effectiveness: None-Low
Block Effectiveness: Medium-High
*Increased DEF when equipped, however blocking attacks with it will not nullify damage and rather soft block damage inbound.*
*The only exception to this is if it's held by someone physically strong like Magic Frisk.*
*When using FIGHT with this, reticles can come from both sides instead and starts slow, but quickly speeds up rapidly.*
**Affected Axe**
60 ATK
`[* Second weapon too deadly for liking, but seems to flicker.]`
`[* Goodluck getting countered with this.]`
Parry Effectiveness: None [Due to flicker.]
Block Effectiveness: None [Due to flicker.]
*Due to it being a flickering type weapon, it means it can deal extremely scary damage even if it's easy to miss. Counters are most likely to fail against this kind of weapon here.*
**Energetic Tank Club**
65 ATK
`[* I gave this weapon a additional name of Club,]`
`[because once you hit it, it only explodes once.]`
`[* Don't hurt yourself with it.]`
Parry Effectiveness: None
Block Effectiveness: None
*Upon a successful hit on anything, explodes only once per battle, dealing damage to both side with the target taking heavier damage here.*
**Draining Scythe**
70 ATK
`[* Not as deadly as curved dagger, but each hit grants you a heal.]`
Parry Effectiveness: Medium
Block Effectiveness: Low-Medium
*Unique reticles system, instead of rectangle attack box, square attack box. And adds on vertical reticles to it too.*
*Heals the user of said weapon per hit.*

**Electricial Lasso**
90 ATK

`[* Do not recharge unless against the most annoying of UM's]`
`[for extra damage.]`
Parry Effectiveness: None
Block Effectiveness: None
*Inflicts 'Electricified' to target on hit which increases electric damage taken for the said target.*
**Uncharged Drill**
95 ATK
`[* Runs on electricity and energy. Unsafe mentally.]`
`[* Better to not recharge it anyway.]`
Parry Effectiveness: Low
Block Effectiveness: Medium-High
*In theorized genocide route, it is safe to assume that this weapon's recharged, making it deal massive damages in overall deadlier than Real Knife.*
*However, Deadly Greatshield completely levels both of the weapons at attack damage total and especially other purposes anyway.*
**Sturdy Greatshield**
100 ATK
`[* This shield seems like you can use it to power through weaker enemies with ease!]`
`[* Resilent to lots of types with exception of those capable of piercing defense.]`
Parry Effectiveness: None
Block Effectiveness: Massive
*Extremely resilent meant that it won't break from damage, but due to it counting as superheavy, it disables swift movements.*

**Deadly Greatshield [THEORIZED GENOCIDE WEAPON]**
NO KNOWN ATK ESTIMATION
`[* Makes quick work of everything.]`
`[* Still resilent.]`
Parry Effectiveness: Low-Medium
Block Effectiveness: Massive
The weapon is basically Sturdy Greatshield but with sawblade attached to it.
*If anyone dead in the mind were to ever use [FIGHT] with this equipped,*
*the fight bar may show up, but there's one little twist.*
**THE ENTIRE ATTACK BAR IS MET WITH FLOODING RETICLES LINE!**
*which they can all be pressed, so it's literally just mash to kill the enemy to beyond overkill.*
*If in a nutshell, basically constant 999999's.*
*The attack in 3d can be represented as bunch of slashes coming from everywhere in rapid succession for a bit per each swing.*
*While it may be still superheavy, the way more stamina loss and such doesn't apply in this genocide route theory.*
###ARMORS:
**Bandage**
0 DEF
`[* ...How did you end up being this hurt,]`
`[anyway to be using this?]`
`[* Anyway, reapplying it helps stop bleeding.]`
*Retains what the original bandage does, allowing for near-always success of FLEEing, until you realize it only works against non-boss type UM's and such.*
*Upon unequipped, become consumable. Heals 10 HP upon re-applying.*
*Instantly erases 'Bleeding' status effect or stops a bleeding upon re-applying.*
**Faded Ribbon**
3 DEF
`[* Apparently with this, you tend to seem cuter.]`
`[...Don't expect that to stop UM's, though.]`
*Nothing much happens, unfortunately with this.*
**Manly Bandanna**
7 DEF
`[* Emphasis on the mispell.]`
`[Besides that, it has.. 'Symbol of strength' written on it.]`
*Dialogue changes when at Mid-Part 1 or Chapter 1, no further changes after that, the below here is after the said change has occurred. Due to 'Asterisk' finding out how Human Languages can be.*
`[* Turns out it doesn't matter if you say 'Bandana']`
`[or bandanna. Still has 'Symbol of Strength' written on it.]`
**Old Tutu**
10 DEF
`[* Don't get ahead of yourself.]`
`[Such protective armor like that, while works against magic..]`
`[* Have yet to prove against Physical.]`
**Cloudy Glasses**
5 DEF
`[* Glasses marred with wear, as you can describe it.]`
`[Increases INV by 9. (Be Invulnerable for longer after a hit.)]`
*Can affect how fast KR drains HP. Besides that, retains what cloudy glasses does originally.*
**Stained Apron**
11 DEF
`[* A armor item with natural healing.]`
`[Heals you 1 HP every turn.]`
*Pretty much original kind of Stained Apron.*
**Cowboy Hat**
12 DEF
`[* Decent armor both for defense and attack side.]`
`[Increases ATTACK by 5.]`
*Basically like the original cowboy hat armor item.*
**Heart Locket**
15 DEF
`[* It says "Best Friends Forever."]`
`[You should be able to know who values this a lot here.]`
`[* Beware that it can't help much with physical damage.]`
*Like the Heart Locket in original, becomes 'The Locket' with 99 DEF when found on genocide route.*
*The difference being is that physical damage breaks through this DEF.*
**Temmie Armor**
20 DEF
`[* Surprisingly a armor that works both against Magical]`
`[and against Physical kinds of attacks. You can rely on this.]`
`[* Increases ATK by 10 and INV slightly along with natural healing.]`
`[This means you also gain 1 HP every turn.]`
*Like the original one, increases ATK by 10, increases INV slightly and heals by 1 HP every turn. The difference however is that its DEF actually works against physical damage aswell, making it actually the first armor to be reliable when dealing with Physical and Magical kinds of Damages.*
*Not to mention its healing by 1 HP every turn is also ridiculous, until the realization that HM Frisk is dealing with strong and dangerous UM's anyways, so all that is going to be useful there.*
**Backshield Plating**
25 DEF
`[* Incredibly-useful starting armor,]`
`[gives 3-hit shield to help you live longer.]`
*As the dialogue implies, it gives 3-hit shield, which has no HP however. Only how many hits the said shield can take before going out.*
**Platforms Side Cannons**
45 DEF
`[* It spins for each shot just so]`
`[you can do it again.]`
*[Starts off with one when using FIGHT first time of the fight.]
[Then anymore continous FIGHT usages makes it two shots instead of one.]
[Mostly due to circle component in the side cannons spinning to fire the other cannon and so on.]
[Shot's ATK: 20]*
*[Hidden Property: Reduces speed due to the weight of this thing.]*







SIX-SOULS STATE:
*`This can practically work with any souls as long as it's up to six and is compatible, the mechanics would then add up in cooperation and form a team in overall with HM Frisk being the Leader!`*
*HM Frisk WILL not be empowered by this, however.*
*The souls are unable to throw healings when having to move along unless the ability says something about it.*

*The abilities here are incomplete and would only be further worked on after the human soul characters in underground part or chapter are done. [Part/Chapter 1 basically.]*

###HM PATIENCE:
**Waiting Time**
Negative Status Effects to any allies near the soul and especially on HM Frisk, expires faster.
Positive Status Effects lasts longer and Neutral Status Effects are nullified.
**Preparation**
Slowly gains more knives over time, but rarely would one of it be green of which would be thrown to HM Frisk.
###HM BRAVERY:
**Arrogance**
The orange soul gains orange glow, rendering it invincible to damage for a short while or less, but also immobile. Duration extends if its protection continues to work. But can also immediately end.
**Respect**
The orange soul throws out thumbs up heal everytime HM Frisk's performance is successful on a action and is significant.
###HM INTEGRITY:
**The Saving Grace**
The blue soul will dash in to save HM Frisk from danger at times.
Medium Cooldown.
**Everlasting Stability**
Able to both heal HM Frisk and dodge attacks.
###HM PERSERVANCE:
**Trapping Line**
The purple soul can stop attacks completely dead in their tracks by deploying purple lines around the field, can also trick foes into it and force them to have limited movement.
**Much-Needed Supplier**
The purple soul starts healing when HM Frisk is in trouble, but has limited amount of heals, however are more beneficial than the rest.
###HM KINDNESS:
**Cheer Up**
The green soul has more impact on HM Frisk's DT Levels when cheering unlike every other people's cheering.
**Supportive Kindness**
Kindness will always support HM Frisk no matter the circumstances, throwing a healing item to them at available times that instantly heals on contact.
Possesses the ability to transfer damage its protected person gets to itself.
###HM JUSTICE:
**The Fair Helping and Vengeance**
The yellow soul will interfere depending on how much in the wrong the opponent is, if HM Frisk needs help and how unfair the fight is for them. Or if the opponent has literally made too much crimes to atone for.
Can basically shoot down attacks with exception of beams or explosions. [Unless it blows up the source first.]
If the opponent wants to deal with constant bullets 24/7, they can either be too much in the wrong or be extremely unfair to HM Frisk in general.
Will not leave any other foes out besides the target.
Will also heal HM Frisk to balance out the situation.
**Watchful Soul**
Yellow soul will immediately shoot at any hiding foes spotted first priority.

#`SOULS DESPERATION`
**[Weakest / Least performance, but strongest one of HM Frisk and their six souls condition!]**
*`Works regardless of HM Frisk's DT Levels, but is most tiring for HM Frisk as due to micro-managing.`*
`HM FRISK RECEIVES NO DEFENSE BENEFITS, FULLY VULNERABLE BUT MAKES UP FOR IT WITH ALL SOULS IN A RING AROUND HM FRISK.`
[The music to listen to during this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv9WRM-3td8)
**The soul's DESPERATION**
If HM Frisk is about to face a fatal damage, the souls all together goes in to take the damage for them, the damage being split across all of them with at maximum being half of the soul's HP.
**Last Stretch**
If this state is at massive disadvantage or is close to going down, the souls would circle around HM Frisk much faster that the ring effect is more visible. Tiring HM Frisk out further, but boosting their ATK to abnormal levels.

#`SOULS COOPERATION`
**[The middle ground of performance for HM Frisk and their six souls condition!]**
*`Essentially the most often seen state, requires HM Frisk to be up to DT Level 4.`*
*`HM Frisk's DEF gains a passive.`*
[The music to listen to during this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdHOu9K1Wyk) (THIS IS SHARED WITH HM ASRIEL'S MUSIC TO LISTEN TO!)
**The soul's BARRIER**
If HM Frisk is about to face a fatal damage, the souls diverts their help to them, causing HM Frisk's HP to only go down to 1 instead. This won't work if it's already at 1 though.

#`MASS SYNERGIZATION`
**[Peak performance of HM Frisk and their six souls condition! Last seen used against HM FloweyX after the souls heard Frisk's call.]**
*`Only works if ALL of the said souls are at their peak level and are willing to help HM Frisk.`*
*`HM Frisk's DT Levels becomes a enhancer in this.`*
[The music to listen to during this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvLCax9c2Hg)
**The soul's SYNERGY**
The souls no longer are stopped from healing by dodging.
Each hit from HM Frisk now downs all defenses that nullifies their attack, a automatic DEF drop to 0 in another words.
