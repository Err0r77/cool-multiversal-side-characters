>" for those who wishes an unfortunate experience. "

-H!HM Sans.
###PERSONALITY:

- This sans's shown to be more caring, even though it's mostly UT Sans, how he works is slightly different still, somehow being literally the best sans to comfort you if HM Frisk's not the way to go.

- He doesn't fear death too, don't ask me. Ask him.

- He does have a secondary role aside from being 'The Judge', he does do some delivery too if he doesn't find much to do that is if anything.

>" what makes me special? dunno, try finding that out yourself. "

-H!HM Sans.

>" SANS WAKE UP, YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO WRITE HERE, NOT FALL ASLEEP! "

-H!HM Papyrus.
###MECHANICS:
- **KR**
UT Sans stuff.

- **Percentage Damage**
H!HM Sans is capable of toggling it, although having it on makes him do only 1% percentage damage.
Extremely deadly with KR.

- **Reality Frames [RF]**
During opponent's soul i-frame, if they get hit by a attack that's the same transparency as their soul, the hit's counted as if it was without i-frame and restarting i-frame all over again.
H!HM Sans is shown to possess flickering blaster attacks.
If active with KR, it does double damage instead of simple hit again. Since i-frame's non-existant. Inflicts Hard KR aswell.

- **Hard KR**
Make a move too fast and it'll wipe off 25% of the target's total HP. [100% to 75%, 75% to 50% and so on.]
Turns the entire bar into a color too, darker purple than the normal KR.

- **Overlap**
H!HM Sans's attacks are unable to interact with other's attacks, especially objects used to block. Thus it overlaps, phasing through.
Makes blocking attacks against H!HM Sans useless and intercepting H!HM Sans's attacks also useless.

- **Broken time and space**
Random occurance, for each time it seems to happen however often leads to 'Time Split' effect. Know time paradox sans? That's basically this. But only lasts for a bit before it's back to normal.
Only one of the two sans'es here is the one. If the other suffers death, it won't affect the fight.

- **Glitching Attacks**
This is both a blessing and a curse. Those kinds of attacks can include either a glitching blaster or a glitching bone. Those attacks can skip ahead by some seconds or suddenly end up in another place.
Although he finds this type of attack necessary to use despite it unpredictable nature for him.

- **" time can mess up in so many ways, and this is just one of them. "**
Passive in battle encounters. Green squares are drifting off slowly. Once they drift off too far, white squares would come in and thus. Bones will be launched out of those squares as a auto-attack.


>" find those cool? here's how i do em. "
>[* Sans shot a blaster at the ground. Nothing happened.]

-H!HM Sans.

###QUOTES:

- " Guess this world's really a deathcage, huh? " 

- " even if im in most minor roles, theres still that one line. "

- " normally i would say [dont let bed bugs bite you]... if this situation wasn't so grim. "

- " legendary sock that not even i could pick up. "

- " ...do you ever get the thought of, yknow, giving up? no? "

###COMBAT EFFECTIVENESS:
**DIFFICULTY AGAINST IT: [Easy] > [Unforgiving] - He still isn't too hard, but if his KR activates, just pray that you aren't on it other end of its unique attack patterns.**

- His Reality Frames is what makes him stronger than UT Sans on normal levels, including 2 ATK.

- He can plan well with his attacks or come up with a plan. This was shown twice, coming up with one for making HM Frisk determined again and usually caring more to not be late on situations again.

- His KR enables his percentage damage to a lot, allowing him to destroy murderous gods. Especially when his overlap mechanic cooperates with this.

- It should be noted that he has multple ways of dodging too. He can flicker to dodge a attack, do a clink-clink to dodge a attack, teleport to dodge a attack and move to dodge a attack.

- Him having 5 HP and loaded up on legendary hero'es means that he can easily be harder than just 'Easy' temporarily. Although it not being permanent means he's still an 'Easy Monster' till something says otherwise.

- Fighting him in H!HM Last Corridor means he has the advantage, being able to collapse the place to instantly win a fight. The same can go for any unstable places that he can just teleport out of. This of course is unless the opponent can get out in time before death.

- Top-destroyer of the UM's due to this.

- He still maintains his promise to protect the human, in this case. HM Frisk. Although hes well aware that HM Frisk can also take care of themselves well. So he only arrives when they really need help.



###ABILITIES:
- HM Sans is capable of 'Flickering Magic'.
This allows him to rapidly turn a attack transparent and back. Allowing good usage of Reality Frames.

- He is also shown to possibly last longer in stamina than UT Sans would, due to potentially higher usage of attacks.

**Flickering Magic**
As the name suggests, it makes a attack flicker!

**ADVANTAGE:**

- Reality frames can be abused towards anyone's advantage to have their attack land twice as much, if HM Sans's Reality Frames is a status effect for the enemy.

**DISADVANTAGE:**

- It has it opposites, transparent attack's cannot go through non-transparent soul's and so on.

**PROCESS:**

- There are no process for this.

**ETC:**

- None.

**Unique Magic**
Essentially sans's abilities.

- "Bone Capability" - Summons a bone attack, be it bone jumps or bone barrage.

- "Blue Attack" - In addition to bone capability is that those attacks can be BLUE, making them harmless if the target stands still.

- "Gaster Blaster" - Summons a blaster. It can fire or ram targets.

- "Blue Soul" - Applies a soul effect to the opponent. Being able to change force of the soul's gravity to any direction. Can be called 'Blue Magic'.

- "Shortcut A" - Time and space capability leads to him being able to teleport with this method.

- "Shortcut B" - Shortcuts time and space, in another words. Clink-clink. Allows it to prepare attacks during it and such, aswell.

- "Healing Attacks" - Sans is capable of healing people with green healing version of bone attacks. Not as effective as Papyrus's Healing Magic however.

**ADVANTAGE:**

- Usual sans's advantage stuff.

- However, in addition to this, he can heal people. Making him slightly more dangerous to deal with.

- Combine it with mechanics and this sans's a nightmare for people with high enough LV.

- Overlap mechanic allows the sans's attacks to go uninterrupted.

**DISADVANTAGE:**

- Usual sans's disadvantage stuff.

- Using attack types that are often overused can lead to the opponent's dodging it more effective first try than if they had faced other characters.
Thus forcing the sans to adapt by using new attack patterns.

- Overlap ends up being a double-edged sword, it attacks may not be interrupted, but it cannot interact with opponent's attacks either.

**PROCESS:**

- There are no process for this.

**ETC:**

- None.




###DESCRIPTION:
The unfortunate judge skeleton that was a victim of Broken Time and Space's effects, especially most affected by it.

Despite knowing that whatever the Frisk did, that so happened to break time and space itself. It later on found out that it wasn't the case. Even as far as to forgive them too.

He still keeps his promise, making use of the UM's existence as a way to get monsterkind to protect Frisk instead of also going after it to kill it.
*otherwise that would have been a cruel asgore move.*

Thanks to him and papyrus, this of course caused monsterkind to trust HM Frisk more and more.

He's also well-known for escorting other humans out of RUINS with help of HM Frisk aswell, knowing that RUINS isn't always safe and the only way to actually keep them safe would be SNOWDIN TOWN's safety perimeter.

He is also responsible for being top-destroyer of UM's next to HM Undyne, who can also destroy just as much as HM Sans can.

His brother is known as 'Papyrus', who had received slightly more of a upgrade than him. He seems to treat genocide human's approach as a challenge to him to a friendly fight instead of being naive enough to go down in one blow.

HM Sans is often seen in leads of most things due to this, including scientist part where he helped alphys on making a estimate on how much time can reset to zero or such before this world completely collapses.

For his 'Easy Opponent' description, his KR is a absolute monster in this. Coupled with his new reality frames effect, you get a skeleton who is more effective than UT Sans at beating genocidal people.
