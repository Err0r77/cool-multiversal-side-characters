WEAPON: *DOUBLE BLUE LONG BONES!*

###LIKES:
- Hunting down UM's. [Essentially has become fanatic of this more than 'Human-Hunting Fanatic'.]

- Things going the right way and positive. Although he does like seeing interesting things too, hence why he found AU versions of him really interesting or so.

- Kind people, especially humans. Question him about this and well, get ready to be flooded in reasons.

- UT Papyrus stuff, Cooking spaghetti and for some reason, likes oatmeal with dinosaur eggs.

- Getting a good friendly fight. Or just finding interesting puzzles even.

- Playing fun supportive games or such with the human. Especially HM Frisk. [Example: Healing Race, etc.]

- Obviously respects HM Sans.

- Literally playing music.

###DISLIKES:
- Seeing people sad.

- Situations going downhill.

- Ultimately what everyone expects, combined laziness and bad puns in one.

- People going down the 'bad path'.

- Injury of his friends tends to rise his concern for them. One of reasons he prioritizes help first.

- Seeing some people in the group receive lack of attention. He'll break the streak for them.
This one is shared with HM Frisk too!

###PERSONALITY:
- Essentially what you'd expect from UT Papyrus, except he does things cooler i guess.

- He actually prefers to protect humans first, placing that over himself but not completely, if necessary. But if he had to pick between sacrificing himself and the humans, he would pick himself.

- Hardmode aspects made this papyrus's puzzles better in general. So he is also capable of planning things out better than before

- If the human approaches him and refuses to take the path that he recommends, he'll just assume that they're trying to challenge him. And so the fight begins WITHOUT offguard ending it immediately.

- Challenging him may to lead to him accepting it sometimes. So he may be more of a fan of that too.

- He respects HM Sans more, especially liking his performance against UM's because of how much help that's providing. Although also because he did find something to do, which is delivery role or job, when he doesn't have to judge things apparently.

###ACTIVITY'S WHEN NOTHING TO DO:
- Usually patrols snowdin or it goes hunting for any hostile UM's, however in chapter 2, he usually is less on guarding since UM's have turned neutral. Thus, he is more rarely seen on patrol.

- He may interact with people, too. Making sure to start things up if any.

###MECHANICS:
Aside from UT Papyrus stuff, there are in addition to this:

- **MINIATURE BLUE FABLED ATTACK!**
In combat, the surrounding areas may glow slightly more blue. He can do this anytime he feels like it, just because he can. When he activates it, the glow will flash and that'll be your indication to immediately stop moving before blue bones are shot from everywhere from surrounding areas. Once those passes. Then things can continue.

###QUOTES:

- " WAIT, IS THAT A CHALLENGE? IF SO, I THE GREATER PAPYRUS WILL ACCEPT IT! AS A WAY TO TRY AND DIRECT YOU TO THE RIGHT PATH! " 

- " I, THE GREATER PAPYRUS, PRESENT TO YOU.. A RATHER ACTUALLY INTERESTING PUZZLE! "

###COMBAT EFFECTIVENESS:
**DIFFICULTY AGAINST IT: [Medium] > [Hard] - His increased stats and few new abilities makes him more difficult to beat. Along with his new armor allowing him to take a offguard hit.**

- HM Papyrus patrols and has hunted down UM's before, this makes him a capable one, being able to even fight a genocider if need to.

- His blue bone attacks are nothing to laugh at, get caught in one and chances are. It's up to HM Papyrus by then to choose if he should combo you or not.

- Don't rely on your capability to disable blue soul unless it can disable BOTH of it. This papyrus has 2 blue soul variations and one of which can be more effective.

- Making him play music in middle of the fight leads to difficulty increase.

- You might also be hit with a puzzle as one of attacks from him in the fight, too.

- However, he has no countermeasures against god-like beings. And that may be his downfall in multiversal world's.


###ABILITIES:
- HM Papyrus is shown to do a lot with his attacks, be it 'ARENA HAZARD!' type attack or so.

**Unique Magic**
Essentially papyrus's abilities.

- "Bone Capability" - Summons a bone attack, be it bone jumps or bone barrage.

- "Blue Attack" - In addition to bone capability is that those attacks can be BLUE, making them harmless if the target stands still.

- "Blue Soul" - Applies a soul effect to the opponent. Being able to change force of the soul's gravity to any direction. Can be called 'Blue Magic'.

- "Bluer Soul" - It basically 'turns souls bluer', possibly navy blue. But one thing's for sure, the soul falls faster and pressing up key enables no-gravity for the soul till the key's not held. Crashing into a wall at a speed causes damage.

- "Healing Attacks" - Papyrus is capable of healing people with green healing version of bone attacks. Healing magic-capable too. Really effective if anything.

- "Attack Cancel" - Papyrus can make all of his attacks vanish, making it basically really hard for him to accidently kill someone.

- "Special Attack Bone" - Papyrus can summon a explosive bone that can connect with bone attacks, however those special attack bones can explode to 'blast' their foes away! Sending bone shrapnels aswell from it exploding on the bones connected to it too!

**ADVANTAGE:**

- Usual papyrus's advantage stuff.

- Bluer soul allows for more crazy kind of attacks. Aswell as being able to bypass multple counters meant for blue soul!

- Can do plenty of bone attacks at once unlike HM Sans here.

**DISADVANTAGE:**

- Usual papyrus's disadvantage stuff.

- The abilities are not well-equipped against situations where it has to fight a god-like being. There's no chance for this papyrus winning in that case.

- Him not having too much changes can be a problem since people can predict him. So he may need support sometimes.

**PROCESS:**

- There are no process for this.

**ETC:**

- None.


###DESCRIPTION:
The great tall skeleton who has taken interest in patrol more than human hunting for now. Where his brother held onto the promise and was able to forgive HM Frisk.

He can be relied on as a second positive emotional boost if HM Frisk is not available. Double that with his care for being cool and hes a good alternative already.

Unfortunately he is lower in combat capability when it comes to defending from universal threats due to no equipment that helps with defeating gods yet.

He is still well known for his performance though. Especially music performance and even does well at healing when needed. Although for his UM-hunting goal, undyne had to give him proper armor so he doesn't end up being torn into smiling shreds.

But even then, he's still tough for what he does. For most of the time he may not give his all. And in those other times he does.
