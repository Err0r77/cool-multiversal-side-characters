###PERSONALITY:
- HM Undyne is similar to Regular Undyne, however. It may be more silent or it can immediately strike it spear upon a hostile.

- Although usually does things for justice, it may also even be determined in it believes. But would hate to not be fair to it opponent's, that is unless, of course the entire world's threatened by a literal threat.

- Never gives up in fight's, usually fighting to the death unless it's better off with proper strategy.

- It plan of attacks shows that it's also, capable of planning. And have been shown to be quick at spotting aswell, being on alert and having it guard up more than before.

- Still goes with absurd method's sometimes, even overkill.

###ACTIVITY'S WHEN NOTHING TO DO:
- It has been seen only doing patrol's for now, maybe more's planned soon?

###MECHANICS:
- **Damage scaling**
It damage can never be low. Thus, it scales with the opponent's. It would not be too high either, but that's only as long as undyne's willing to be fair.

- **Precise Aiming**
Unlike regular undyne, this one surpasses the regular one by a lot in aiming, being able to snipe just about anyone as long as it has sight on them, from snowdin town to snowdin forest.

- **Determined Heroine**
In rare cases, it may choose to enter undying state whether it goes heroic speech! This cannot be interrupted as if you try to, it'll start fighting WHILE speaking!

###COMBAT EFFECTIVENESS:
**DIFFICULTY AGAINST IT: [Hard] > [Unforgiving] - HM Undyne's been heading for the goal to be a absolute fighter. With it new mechanic's and such allows her to unleash crazier, deadlier methods necessary.**

- If HM Undyne, ever, goes undying. The opponent's screwed. If not, they'll have to bare with how much more difficult the battle will become. Making it hardly possible for them, depending on their performance.

- HM Undyne with one of it moves now able to clear entire attack's in it way, making them deadlier in general when combined with the fact that it spear projectiles has a new attack type. **It should not be taken that it can destroy reality cannon's attacks. But rather while the attack remains, the move gets pushed back slowly.**

- Counter-attack, block and even dodging is to be expected from them. This fight was never easy to begin with.

- The damage scaling is never low, thus, the opponents are faced to face the fact that their HP can be destroyed by a combo of attack's.

- It undying state is barely seen unless H!HM is facing a grim case where no one else but its undying is able to solve this.

- HM Undyne can aim their attacks really well, something that normal undyne can't do. And her attack pattern planning combined made her attacks terrifying to face, even from afar.
