###STATS:
9950 / 9950 HP

ATK estimated to be in massive numbers or just infinite.
DEF estimated to be in massive numbers or just infinite.

SPD: Yet to be known, while stationary due to its size, could probably move at medium speeds for its size.

WEAPON: None? [No ATK-increasing weapon.]
ARMOR: None? [No DEF-increasing armor.]
###LIKES:
- Literally suffering in general alongside cruelty.

- Plan working out as intended.

- Enjoyment or entertainment.

- Anything new.

###DISLIKES:
- Things not going their way, obviously.

- Literally being bored.

###PERSONALITY:
- ...I don't think i need to explain entire personality of Flowey again. Besides being manipulative, cruel and a planner aswell.

###ACTIVITY'S WHEN NOTHING TO DO:
- Nor this either to be done again either, too.

- If there was even one to begin with, it would just be doing something new everytime when it gets an idea.

###MECHANICS:
- **The SOULS**
During fights where the person has no genocidal intents [such as wiping out a race or more so], the souls may attempt to come in for the person to call out for help to.
If done so, the attacks from the said SOUL will become healing, helping them out severely and prolonging their survival.
It can only go up to six before the souls now decide to drop FloweyX's DEF to zero.

###QUOTES:
- Yet to be made.

###COMBAT EFFECTIVENESS:
**DIFFICULTY AGAINST IT: [Hard] > [Unforgiving] - Depending on circumstances, people can go from being screwed to feeling like they're going through hell.**

- There isn't much to say about this, although FloweyX prefers to play with the target for sake of causing them to suffer for cruel reasons.

- The best chance the people fighting this have would be if the souls decided to revolt or even rebel against FloweyX, otherwise they better hope they have abilities to be able to be on par with its outrageousness capability.



###ABILITIES:
- FloweyX has a LOT of abilities at its arsenal, just pray that you can survive the onslaught of attacks usage.

***UNIQUE MAGIC!***
**First Phase Magic**
'First Phase', or rather the original one before more chaotic parts later on.

- "FILE 2" -
FloweyX can freely save and load here to load positions and attacks ongoing.

- "FILE 3" -
SAVED at the start of a fight. FloweyX can FREELY abuse this to win a fight with offguard hit. Or to restart it.
May cause hostile reactions from the souls though.

- "The rest of FILES" -
FILE 1 seems to be reserved for something else.
FILE 6 is unused and is in multipurpose use.

- "Arm Slam" -
Slams one of the two massive arms on the targeted positions, massive ouch if it manages to hit despite the short startup.

- "Shockwaving Beam" -
FloweyX blasts a beam from the mouth, with impact causing large and extremely tall eruption of said beam's energy in waves all around the sides, leaving short gaps to go through.

- "Destructive Nuke" -
FloweyX basically drops a massive-range bomb, with powerful shockwave for good measure.

- "Flowey Bombs" -
FloweyX drops a bomb with flowey face on the sides of it. Nothing much else to mention. Besides it being able to drop those in rapid succession.

- "Two-Patterns Vines Strikes" -
Picks a pattern out of the two, if first, same to original undertale.
If second, wave by wave of those warning signs with wave by wave vines.

- "Seperating Spiked Snakes" -
Like in the original kind of bossfight of this, sends out circular cactus-like snakes with mouths. Except after a short while of bouncing off of things, it then falls apart into small projectiles everywhere, which bounces off walls or border few times.

- "Two-Rowed Pellet Circles" -
Circular warning signs appears, before being surrounded in pellets and then a second row of pellets in the circle, the first one then fires first quickly then the second one right after.

- "QuickSaw Triplets" -
Upper eyes of FloweyX does quick charge up before each, fires off 3 fast spinning X-shaped projectiles each, targeting the foe with two projectiles to the sides. Upon impact with anything that it cannot break through, shatter into many smaller projectiles knocked away before fading.

- "Seven-Projectile Waves" -
Lower eyes of FloweyX does quick charge up before each, fires off 7 X-shaped projectiles. Immediately enough to cover the whole battlefield since it's done in several bursts, or rather constantly. Similar to triplets, impact with any border it cannot break through leads to it breaking apart, except it shatters into 4 smaller projectiles spreaded out instead.

- "Venus Flytrap" -
A arm of FloweyX or 'hand' of it, grows a venus flytrap before pulling in flies and the targets. Instant soul kill if caught in venus flytrap closing due to it immediately snapping closed and opening violently.
The hardmode difference being that flies eaten by it have small projectiles scattered everywhere in a wave before falling back down per each flies killed by it.

- "Intensive Flamethrowers" -
FloweyX deploys a large flamethrower for each of its 'hand's one by one as they burn in a sweeping motion, leaving behind lasting flames that disappears after a short while before the other one comes in.

- "Vine FingerGuns" -
The sides of the battlefield would have flower stem-grown finger guns appear and fire off. Each one having random intervals of exploding with flashing as the indicator of it. AOE coverage.

**FLASHING LASER Phase Magic**
FloweyX's both of the eyes will be flashing rapidly with exception of TV itself.
See '[Your Best Nightmare Dual Mix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyXnOYEuqsA&t=193)' by iwannabethecollector on YT for why this is the case.
Absolutely hell to dodge.

- "FILE 2" -
FloweyX can freely save and load here to load positions and attacks ongoing.

- "FILE 3" -
SAVED at the start of a fight. FloweyX can FREELY abuse this to win a fight with offguard hit. Or to restart it.
May cause hostile reactions from the souls though.

- "The rest of FILES" -
FILE 1 seems to be reserved for something else.
FILE 6 is unused and is in multipurpose use.

- "Eye Blasts" -
FloweyX's rapid-flashing eyes will suddenly have waves of lights shining before instant-blasting instant-travel beams bursts by bursts in fast succession for a bit.

- "Lasering Bouncing Spiked Snakes" -
Flashing ones are fired out instead of the usual, with short life-span after few bouncing that those explodes in wave of long quick-traveling lasers. Short gaps to go through.

- "Quick Triplet Beams" -
Upper eyes of FloweyX does quick charge up before each, fires off 3 beams in quick bursts, being troublesome to the dodging field immediately.
Has quick warning line indicator.

- "Seven-Beam Waves" -
Lower eyes of FloweyX does quick charge up before each, fires off 7 beams in a constant firing motion, being swung to the left then to the right, or stopping and suddenly firing again.
Has quick warning line indicator.

- "Shockwaving Beam" -
FloweyX blasts a beam from the mouth, with impact causing large and extremely tall eruption of said beam's energy in waves all around the sides, leaving short gaps to go through.

- "Plasma Flamethrowers" -
Like 'Intensive Flamethrowers', but instead of burning, it fires out long slow-moving plasma's with gaps inbetween each alongside the quick sweeping motion of the flamethrowers.

- "Vine Finger Lasers" -
Like vine fingergun attack, but instead of bullets or projectiles, colored beams that either goes up or down. Mayhem or chaotic amounts of those are usually fired at a time.

**Second Phase Magic**
FloweyX decides to now use different attacks due to what's going on, their FILEs in this state are completely disabled due to hardmode nature of souls, but would have to be defeated first before it really goes down.

- "Circling Pellets" -
Similar to constant pellet circle attacks, this one spawns only once but goes in and out constantly with maximum of FAR distance. Giving even HM Frisk trouble if this were to be used in succession. Which FloweyX does.

- "Crazed Triplets" -
Similar to QuickSaw Triplets in what it does, but the projectiles curves more inward each shot during the pattern till it spreads out instead further enough.

- "Projectile Rush Waves" -
Lower eyes of FloweyX does quick charge up before each, fires off 7 X-shaped projectiles. Immediately enough to cover the whole battlefield since it's done in several bursts, however it's in rapid succession, this attack ends fast, but causes trouble fast.
Can IMMEDIATELY be followed up with another attack.

- "Laser Spread" -
The mouth charges up before firing out bunch of long lasers in fast succession. It can either be precise targeting or spreaded out. While projectiles are fast, some of the projectiles ends up being slow to be carried over to the next attack.

- "Destructive MOAB" -
FloweyX drops a MOAB kind of bomb instead of a Nuke type and oh you thought it does less? It leaves behind a damaging field of magic for that to carry over to next attack.

- "Flowey Cannons" -
A fine reference to AC-130, flowey summons cannon barrels from each corner of the screen and begins to bombard the area for a bit with some weapons firing either at same time or one by one.
One barrel being slow-firing but large caliber, the second being a gatling gun that requires the target to keep moving, the third being a autocannon that causes obstacles with explosions.
And lastly, a air-to-air missile launcher that homes on target.

- "Arm Thorns" -
A arm flashes white before after half of a second, firing out thorns in all directions, the projectiles going at medium speed. And can be a good offguard attack for its reliability.

- "Vine Swipe" -
The bushes part gains a use, flowers forms and falls towards the target before breaking apart by a non-harmful vine swipe for smaller projectiles to fly out in all directions.
The said vine cannot be hit during the process.

- "Breaking Spiked Snakes" -
Like in the original kind of bossfight of this, sends out circular cactus-like snakes with mouths.
Which actually ends up being aimed almost sideways but close to diagonal, causing a harder attack which then breaks apart at the most bottom for the circular cactus-like parts to fly out in a wave towards target's direction.

- "Arm Mouth" -
A arm of FloweyX or 'hand' of it, grows a literal plant-like mouth before chomping a entire side of the field by snapping mouth closed. Instant kill upon hit. [Against anyone with extreme DEF or high, they'd be heavily damaged or crippled.]
Surprise element attack.

- "Intensive Icethrowers" -
FloweyX deploys a large flamethrower-like weapon for each of its 'hand', however the difference is that those then starts freezing the area, inflicting slowness to everyone during this. Causes follow-up attempts to be unavailable but can be used with another attack till it ends.

- "Vine FingerMissile" -
The sides of the battlefield would have flower stem-grown finger guns appear and fire off. Each one's projectile being a literal missile that has pathfinding homing that automatically explodes after a short duration, but fast one despite it being easy to miss.

**ADVANTAGE:**

- "Do i need to say ANYTHING about this?"

**DISADVANTAGE:**

- "Again, do i need to say ANYTHING about this?!"

**PROCESS:**

- "Your process is DEATH OVER MILLION TIMES!"

**ETC:**

- There's no advantages or disadvantages because of the madness scale FloweyX can easily cause while being in this state, thus, making it one of actually scary ones to fight due to this. And hope that you're still alive by the end of all this chaos too if you even can survive it all in one go.



###DESCRIPTION:
One thing for sure, this is one HELL of a abomination from if you let Flowey have six human souls in H!HM, you get absolute beast of a character fully willing to cause suffering.

At the time of this happening Flowey decided they had enough and decided to play with HM Frisk for a bit, even going too far to getting the souls and doing this all over again out of interest.

This also was one of events that SERIOUSLY CONCERNED HM Frisk, due to the magnitude of the situation it can go to.

But FloweyX wasn't about killing them, that'd be a mistake, infact he would be going as far as to make them suffer a lot till their determination breaks apart.

Fortunately for HM Frisk, during the mayhem, the souls one by one joined in and eventually helped HM Frisk seperately till all of the souls have had been called out to, this in turn leading to the souls now being on HM Frisk's side.

Thus, taking down the SAVE and LOADing capability till end of the battle, this caused FloweyX to now have intentions to recapture the souls alongside HM Frisk.

...HM Frisk didn't go down without a fight, obviously. Thanks to their thought with what they could do with the souls, they were able to defeat FloweyX due to the cooperation with their soul friends.

Alas, causing HM Flowey to regret such decision and eventually, go back to what he originally was doing due to how it ended there.

*...Atleast HM Flowey had some entertainment during all this, especially throwing UM-1's at HM Frisk a bit.*
