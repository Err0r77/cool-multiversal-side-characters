###ASTERISK: ==========================\
5 Soul HP? [100% Stability HP?] ('Asterisk' 's HP is non-existant, hence the stability HP thing here-)

??? ATK?
??? DEF?

SPD: ???

**LIKES:**

- Things going well and as planned for HM Frisk, especially itself.

- Fair nature of the environment. [Where HM Frisk's choices can matter and such, not played and toyed around with.]

- HM Frisk's world being fixed successfully and fully, atleast stabilized enough.
Interesting Info's.

**DISLIKES:**

- HM Frisk's world being in extreme danger of destruction.

- Unfair nature of the environment.

- Some outsider's actions. [it can basically despise some outsiders for what they do, best to be on it good side here.]

- God's thinking they can play and toy with worlds or HM Frisk without consequences.

- Broken time and space nature. [sole reason they offered help to HM Frisk in first place.]

**PERSONALITY:**

- Despite it liking and disliking part, it is sometimes silent and sometimes active. Extremely intelligent and does things much better than HM Frisk can do. They're what you consider a important component to help HM Frisk on decisions and such.

- Although may not be as positive, it can plan well and alert HM Frisk of what's going on and when extremely powerful beings enters the world they're in.

- Powerslaps people for doing 'bad things' infront of HM Frisk with 'Energy swipes', mainly to remind them about it or just shows up to stop them there. Or so.

- Without it, HM Frisk would be in way more trouble.

- They despise how multiversal beings toys with worlds, and this 'Asterisk' is responsible for why HM Frisk's protected well against those.

- It also grew used to being friends with HM Frisk despite being part of their soul the entire time, helping them when needed against high-power foes or especially gods. Or if HM Frisk has to be saved through life-saving ability and show up to help them aswell. 

**ABILITIES:**
Asterisk's energy cannot be disrupted, yet they can disrupt the opponent's. What gives?
One thing's clear though. Those abilities are powerful as hell in their right situations.

**Offense Abilities:**

- "Energy Swipe" - Yet to have a proper description, can disrupt attacks it hits.

- "Guided Storm" - Mass interception! 'Asterisk' fires out barrage of guided energy blasts. Of which beats out every single swarm type attacks at best. And intercepts attacks that has impact effects really well too on dealing with those. You'd need a durable projectile to prevent near-immediate interception stopping it the moment it's fired. Spammable as hell but takes toll on energy the longer it's used. 

- "Surprise Watch" - Shoots a decoy attack. At any point in time, it can make the decoy attack suddenly turn into actual attack and strike the target. Hitting the decoy leads to the target's energy flow suddenly being disrupted for a bit. Forcing the attack turn to end if in turn-based.

- "Status Effect Debuffs" - As the name suggests, minor and major debuffs. Minor debuffs can immediately apply to the opponent but if it's a major one. It'll have to be shot in the form of a attack. 

**Defense Abilities:**

- "Quicksave" - As the quote goes: 'WARNING: DEATH IMMINENT-', right before 'Asterisk' immediately saves HM Frisk from death by reversing current-existant time to before HM Frisk ran into a death path. [Example: If it happened due to Sans's 'MERCY' attack, it'll be rewinded up to before MERCY was used.]
This can also immediately confuse the target on what just happened since HM Frisk will suddenly take another path in unpredictable manner there to avoid that death path.
Doing so however causes [ITEM] to fall and the [ASSIST] to take it place. 'Asterisk' would also have to show up in that part of HM Frisk's soul for stability reasons. After all, this ability upon use destabilizes random part of HM Frisk. It cannot be done again as anymore than that would lead to HM Frisk's death instantly.
Beware that once it's used, HM Frisk has to either finish the situation it's dealing with fast or get back to it own world, otherwise it'll have to face mass instability situation, this CANNOT be used as a way to continue fighting for way longer so keep that in mind. 

- "Status Effect Buffs" - As the name implies, 'Asterisk' gives status buff effects to the frisk. The one known currently though is 'Safety Net', in which if HM Frisk ends up about to get hit, 'Asterisk' may choose to activate it and cause HM Frisk's soul flickers rapidly, rapidly moving them from safe spot to another till the status effect estimates the time for safe spot to be enough for HM Frisk to not immediately get hit.
This one has it limits, if the entire world's about to explode, goodluck trying to escape using that.

**Misc Abilities:**

- "Radar-like" - Being part of HM Frisk's soul meant it could look around from HM Frisk's position, being able to alert them and such when spotting something, sees well in the dark too!

- "Sense capability" - Their sensing cannot go unnoticed aswell. Well known for sensing presences or even detecting them immediately the moment they enter within timeline's range or so. It can even be area specific too! Able to sense and feel powers aswell.

- "Inform capability" - Can notify people or especially HM Frisk, even if it has not showed up yet. In form of a text or another way. This also means 'Asterisk' is capable of influencing HM Frisk's UI's. This also enables it to relay info to the frisk aswell!

- "Extreme Interception" - Any outside interference attempting to impact HM Frisk in any way will be intercepted by 'Asterisk', depending on what that is. Even mind control itself! [Example: Code modification attempts, illusions and etc.]

- "Stabilizer" - Can stabilize things once it has pinpointed the instability.

- "Massive-ranged Traveling" - A lot to go through, but it can either morph save stars into white glowing asterisk symbol that will be used to teleport both itself and HM Frisk to somewhere. Depending on what teleportation patterns used, however it usually goes with the ones that doesn't expose locations and cannot be traced, making them really hard to follow. And can become impossible if it ends up curving.
It does not require save starts to function either, it can just warp itself or it can form white glowing asterisk symbol by itself, although it has to be mindful of it energy costs as morphing save stars into warp platforms are easier than to create one by itself. 

- "Code viewing capability" - This also means it can notice ghost's aswell in it view. Adjustable. Or it can analyze code. It can also make slight changes to them if needed. But HM Gaster has easier time doing those, usually. Both HM Gaster and 'Asterisk' though would have to place their focus on it and leave themselves vulnerable if they do decide to. 

- "UI Manipulation Explanation" - It can go as far as to even providing warning signs for HM Frisk upon noticing a attack incoming that HM Frisk should pay attention to. This ability alone is what helped HM Frisk on evasion parts when it comes to attacks from views that frisk won't see.

**Full Power Abilities:**
This one's exclusive to when 'Asterisk' gains a full form. Once that happens. It'll become powerful really fast thanks to these new abilities it'll gain:

**DISADVANTAGES:**

- For what it makes up for is extreme multipurpose and being able to fight gods, it really can't do all that well without help of HM Frisk for weaker ones.

**ADVANTAGES:**

- Disregard power level chart and all that, it's time to see how good opponents are on getting through 'Asterisk'!

**PROCESS:**

- None known yet.

**ETC:**

- Mostly unknown abilities, fight at your own risk.

**DESCRIPTION:**
A mostly mysterious entity, whose's goal is to fix up HM Frisk's broken time and space by helping them achieve it. Making sure their world cannot cause disasterous results once destabilized too much.

It has offered HM Frisk help and they accepted it, however for it to work and be able to help at all times, they decided to sacrifice 5 maximum HP to make some space for 'Asterisk' to be part of the soul. However unknown to them, 'Asterisk' actually holds the 5 HP that they have sacrificed, in case they changed their mind.

It isn't a machine though, it hates how gods toys with people that has feelings and all. Caring for HM Frisk due to the goal. And would make the last seconds before disappearance absolutely worth it too.

Well known for causing a LOT of problems to the opponents upon showing up to help HM Frisk here. And saving HM Frisk from UM-1 at the beginning, too.
