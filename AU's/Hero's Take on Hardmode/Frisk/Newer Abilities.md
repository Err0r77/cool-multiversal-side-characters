###NEW ABILITIES:

- By the time around 19th day or 20th, HM Frisk has gained new magic abilities from their teacher, those are the following:

**Plant Magic**

Thanks to Tomb and the sub-au friend, it has gained the following new abilities:
Disadvantage: No plant magic when at low stamina, not relaxed enough means it can go horribly wrong. Side effect of this one if used wrongly is paralysis.
*Defense Magic.*

- "Shined Sprout Growth" -
Take a flower, focus on it, imagine happy things and then close both palms together. Then the yellow light will be emitted from its hands, causing a sprout to be made.
Place it on any compatible ground and a small tree will be able to be made from it by letting it grow.

- "Flower Stem Growth Second Form" -
Same as flower stem growth move, but the rised hand must be kept up, rising up further too if possible and the focus being on the plant it made for which one to grow.
Improvements can be by focusing as usual on it next, normally. And the concentration to be at usual, making it sturdy and firm in the process.
If the wind isn't that strong, then that means it's doing well then.

- "Plant Blooming" -
Think of a good memory that makes it happy and the focused plant would bloom flowers as a result. Can target the flowers to make it turn into a fruit too.
If a person is to eat that fruit, they relive their own memories.
The fruit is basically a quick health snack.

- "Healing Surge" -
*basically the 'special attack' or 'ult' of Plant Magic here at this point-*
Relaxed form, then have EVERY POSITIVE EMOTIONS in this state.
Which is easier when helped by a person to send warmth to it or such.
When successfully done, a surge of positive energy would flow near and its HP would then be maxed out suddenly.
**Last move on Plant Magic. For now?**


**Fire Magic**

Fire Magic also received a addition too:
Advantage: When tired, it becomes stronger.
Disadvantage: Overuse is not advised due to being able to overheat, can cause burn scars.
*Offense Magic.*

- "Controlled Fire Lighting" -
Basically 'Burn to a crisp' move, but scaled down. Requires focus to be able to be done. Can be done through placing a finger on the target object too.

- "Fire Charge" -
Basic steps of the Fire Magic, then keep the same position and straighten the back a bit, then think of something that makes it uncomfortable and keep that thought. Then hold and put their hand into a fist.
Allowing the fire to then become a bit more bluish but still orange as a result.
*Can overload.*

**Star Magic**

*Not enough moves in this category to have advantages, disadvantages and such yet.*
The newer magic taught by Tomb. Those are the following:
Can be used when on guard at all times.
*May be treated as a defensive mechanism or passive.*
Disadvantage: Don't use it too frequently as it's defensive for a reason. Otherwise it may cause self-damage, which is 50/50, 50% is moderate damage and 50% is light damage. Both only just takes a bit of HP off though.

- "Faint Star" -
Be in a more calmish position, be relaxed and then think of any star, then look down [this part's optional most likely-] for the faint glow to be seen emitting from its hands like stars.
Can act as a save star in some cases and convenient for when running away.

- "Star Aura" -
Deep breath, then sit down and manage the tense and calm at same time, with similar star shape as before. May not require sitting down. Then it'll cause small star aura around itself as a result.

- "Small Star Boost and Capability" -
Make a diamoned with its fingers and then be a bit tenser. Causing two small stars to appear that circles it before causing a ding and a small power boost.
The reason for capability part is due to being able to summon small stars or larger now.
The capability is from later parts though.
The stars can be played with, flinging those around as those flies back to it before giving a small shine. When done with it, disappearing.
Frisk is capable of moving those stars by hand movements whenever it is required to do so.

- "Flicking Stars" -
Basically distraction, flicks stars at people. No big deal with it.

- "Mini-Star Blazing" -
For large, it would be mini-star blazing when thrown, causing it to be a shooting star before it then bursts into a mini-star blazing.
Smaller variants of this are possible,
especially summoning more stars and throwing them for fireworks of Star Blazings. Would look pretty and can do 'Hefty Damage' aswell, which in translation to Hero's sayings, can mean 'Decent Damage'.

- "Star Counter" -
Block with a star, the size and cost varies on how strong and big the incoming attack is, upon success, the star will then explode into small stars that then scatters everywhere.

**Star Magic + Plant Magic**
Thanks to Tomb again, remaining calm to be a bit more relaxed and focused too. And be in position. Basically, mix Star Magic and Plant Magic.
Stars and few pollens will then swarm around it if done so alongside washing away its worries and allowing for big defense boost.
Potential Disadvantage: Having a bad form might lead to consequences of backfiring. May apply to all other magics in this.

- "Star-Supported Plant Form" -
Perform first form plant summon or Flower Stem Growth with the proceedure above before it.
The result would be at first, the summoned one would actually grow up on its own at first, then it would have to focus 'more + bit more' for it to second, grow up into bush and then third, grow up into a tree with fruits.
Happy memories or such causes delicious fruits as far as it's known, no need to be explained again due to it being like turning flowers into fruits.

**Star Magic + Fire Magic**
Thanks to Tomb, the proceedure isn't hard here either considering it should be mix of Fire Magic and Star Magic, but mastering it would be a long way.
Flames and stars would build up around its hands as a aura here when using this mix.
Said to also allow for offense boost, essentially opposite of what mixing star magic with plant magic gives in boosts there too.
Perfect thing for stamina boost aswell.
Potential Disadvantage: Having a bad form might lead to consequences of backfiring. May apply to all other magics in this.

- "Star-Supported Strike" -
Considering the build up is part of it, punch literally anything for it to be casted.
Essentially boosted version of melee. few hits can literally knock out a average person.
And one average strike with it from HM Frisk or usual when boosted, would destroy a training dummy instantly.
A slightly held back or a bit held back one with boosts is also enough to deal a dislocation to a person with slightly more durability than average person too.



**Free DT Magic**

Freely usable DT Magic basically.
Unknown for now, taught by TombFellShift.
